sql code is in R files for extracting data and analysing them there

Each time you log on to start working on these files:
1. First need to ascertain if anyone else has the files open and is currently working on the file you want to work on. 
   To do this, 
	TERMINAL COMMAND:	EXPLANATION:
	who     		lists other users currently on calopterx2.biology.dal.ca
	whodo
2. If no one is working on the file, you can work on it. Lock the file so no one else can work on it while you are:
   	lockfile filename.lockfile
	e.g. lockfile basic_sql_queries.sql.lockfile
3. When you are finished working a file, save it, and unlock:
	rm -f filename.lockfile  			
	e.g. rm -f basic_sql_queries.sql.lockfie
Done!

'queries' folder contains the queries used to create user2 views for srdb
'R' contains the R code to load the data into the workspace and run the analysis
