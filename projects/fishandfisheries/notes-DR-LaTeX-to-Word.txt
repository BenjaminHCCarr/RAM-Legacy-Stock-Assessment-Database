It now seems unavoidable to have to produce Word document version of papers written in LaTeX.

A few ideas:

- in Open Office, make sure that the Tools-Options-Load/Save-Microsoft Office is set correctly for handling equations

- in LaTeX, turn off ligature
\usepackage{microtype} %% no ligature, to facilitate conversion to Word
\DisableLigatures{encoding = *, family = * }

- in LaTeX, turn off hyphenation
\usepackage[none]{hyphenat}  %% no hyphenation, to facilitate conversion to Word

To minimize the pain involved in translating the LaTeX document into Word, I'll be using the following sequence of events:

In Linux:
1 - latex2rtf filename
2 - latex2html filename -split 0
3 - latex filename, then xdvi and "save as text"
4 - now have rtf, html and txt in Word

In Windows:
1 - open filename.tex in Scientific Word and export as rtf (this will nicely translate the equation into MathType)

Then:
Open all 4 files (.rtf,.html,.txt from Linux and .rtf from Windows) in Word and the beautiful PDF from pdflatex and mix-and-match the output into a single Word document.
