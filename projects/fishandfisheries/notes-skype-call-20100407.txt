skype call with Julia, Olaf and Coilin

points to be covered

- reference points: cumbersome, but has to be done

- QAQC: probe people to do QAQC

- SAUP data and how to handle non-fish species and highly migratory species
-> make an srDB-only dendrogram
-> multi-panel for fish species
-> multi-panel for invertebrates species (possibly on one row comparing SAUP to srdb)

- Olaf suggestion: global sum of catch per species (last 10 years) from SAUP and see what percentage of the catch is represented in srdb + same for inverts.
|-> follow up with Olaf on that

- show Table 2 to Reg and make sure that he's ok with it.
|-> top 30 tonnage fisheries

- surplus production model estimates: add to methods 

Julia questions:
- results: notes about Data Thief extractions

- EXCLUDE ASSESSMENTS WITH ONLY CPUE data, i.e. where assess=1 ONLY
-> list of those with CPUE data only
-> keep if an absolute biomass estimate is available

- write-up

- figures and tables

- timeline

- Fogarty/Murawski 
- Manderson
