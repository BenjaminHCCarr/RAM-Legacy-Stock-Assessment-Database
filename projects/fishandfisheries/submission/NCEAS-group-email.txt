Dear colleagues,

Much progress has been made on the RAM Legacy database of stock
assessments over the past year since our NCEAS Working Group ended. As
you know, we used an early version of the database for last year's
Science paper. Since then the database has been under active
development and it has grown to over 350 assessments. 

I am writing to you now to ask for your comments on the attached
manuscript, which Coilin, Julia, Olaf and I have co-authored for
submission to the journal Fish and Fisheries. It presents a summary of
the RAM Legacy database and puts the results in the context of our
knowledge-base of commercially exploited marine fisheries.

We plan on submitting the manuscript on Monday July 12th 2010. We
therefore welcome your comments until Friday July 9th, at which point
a revised version of the manuscript will be put together for
submission.

In particular, we would appreciate your help in completing the reasons
why certain assessments found in Table 2 have not been included in the
database. The stocks for which we are unsure have a question mark in
the last column of Table 2.

If you are unable to send us comments by this Friday, we would still
appreciate receiving them and we will endeavor to incorporate them at
the revision stage.

Thanks in advance for your input. 

Best wishes, 

Dan, Coilin, Olaf and Julia
