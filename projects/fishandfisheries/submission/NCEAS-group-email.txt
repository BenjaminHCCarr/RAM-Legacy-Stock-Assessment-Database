Dear colleague, 
Despite the fact that our NCEAS Working Group has dissolved over a
year ago, a lot of work has happened since. Of concern to this communication
is a draft manuscript that follows up on the database of assessments that
was used for last year's Science paper and that has been under active
development since.

We are seeking your timely comments and queries on the attached
manuscript to be submitted to the journal Fish and Fisheries. This
paper presents a summary of the database that we've assembled and puts
the results in the context of our knowledge-base of marine fisheries.

We plan on sending the manuscript to Fish and Fisheries on Monday July
12th 2010. We welcome your comments until Friday July 9th, at which
point a revised version of the manuscript will be put together for
submission.

All the best.
