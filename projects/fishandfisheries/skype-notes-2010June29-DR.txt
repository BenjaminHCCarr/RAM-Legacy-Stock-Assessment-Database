- life-history traits from FishBase vs. srdb?
-> from FishBase, Trophic Level, a50, Max Length + make it clear that it is from FishBase

- BRPs in the discussion, ICES has great streamlined assessments, but then we use Schaefer to derive comparable BRPs

- Table S2 with Schaefer vs assesment BRPs

- add assessment method to Table S1

- supporting information about the methods, etc.


- how to submit? they don't want PDFs, but they also don't want MS Word equations! Would they accept an Open Office document?
-> only Word 7 equation editor doesn't work well, newest should be fine

- Dan's visit to Woods Hole

TODO:
- year for ICES using VPA

- Indian Ocean bigeye used data thief
- Chilean Mackerel used data thief
-> remove the two stocks from the analyses, and add them back if we hear from the assessment authors

- maybe (or not) how SAUP species list was obtained 

- write about Schaefer derivation in Suppl.?

- number of stocks in original RAM database: in the introduction, give RAM's numbers in details and then state that we have a similar number of stocks now
-> add sentence about salmonids in the introduction

- marine inverts: keep as is

- BRPs: report them by management body

- word on Suresh's paper 

- send PDF document by tomorrow

- assessment method in Table S1
- try gray fried eggs + contour lines 
- labels for Fig. 7
