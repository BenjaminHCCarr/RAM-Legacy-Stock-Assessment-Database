age at 50% maturity -> many entries say "AVAILABLE", so maybe I'll present something else such as age-at-recruitment, or another bioid where we have many entries
-> get it from FishBase, double check


- still need to aggregate the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans for RFMOs, so the fried egg plots have larger number of samples


- beanplot with alternative kernel


- ideas/help for the email to NCEAS people
pass email by Julia before sending

please specifically look at Table 2 and tell us why they aren't there

- ask some questions about what toe.g. Ana Parma re: "stock status" on p.18


people to include on the email:

Pamela Mace
Elisabeth Fulton
Mike Fogarty
Jeremy Collie
Jeffrey Hutchings
Boris Worm
Ray Hilborn
Heike Lotze
Simon Jennings
Trevor Branch
Dirk Zeller
Reg Watson

- contingency table and remove the correlation
- Table 6 blank space
- underestimate over/estimate change that sentence and "systematic"


fully-exploited = around Bmsy

contents of the database vs. the catch data
merits and problems of our database, instead of actually comparing our "global status" 

short paragraph in discussion, or 2 sentences at the end of the first paragraph
more accurate status, but not as gloabl as FAO catch database

FIND OUT IF/HOW TO MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN OUR STATUS AND FAO STATUS

state-space model and meta analysis

try censored kernel to cutoff the beanplot

revise caption for Table 2 / redo Table 2 as per Word document sent by Julia
