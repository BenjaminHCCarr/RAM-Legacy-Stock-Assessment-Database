It now seems unavoidable to have to produce Word document version of papers written in LaTeX.

A few ideas:

- in Open Office, make sure that the Tools-Options-Load/Save-Microsoft Office is set correctly for handling equations

- in LaTeX, turn off ligature
\usepackage{microtype} %% no ligature, to facilitate conversion to Word
\DisableLigatures{encoding = *, family = * }

- in LaTeX, turn off hyphenation
\usepackage[none]{hyphenat}  %% no hyphenation, to facilitate conversion to Word
