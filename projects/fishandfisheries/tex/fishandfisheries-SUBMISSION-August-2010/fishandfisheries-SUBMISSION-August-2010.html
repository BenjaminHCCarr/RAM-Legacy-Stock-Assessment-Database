Abstract</A>
</H1>

<P>
To facilitate global analyses of population dynamics and the status of
fished species, we have assembled a new database, the RAM Legacy
Database, of the most intensively studied commercially exploited
marine fish stocks. Results from assessment models, including time
series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality,
and catch; reference points; and ancillary information on the life
history, management, and assessment methods for each stock.  Here, we
present the first overview of this database and use it to evaluate the
knowledge-base for assessed marine species.  Assessments were
assembled for 324 stocks
(288 fish species representing
45 families, and 36
invertebrate species representing 12
families), including 8 of the world's 10 largest fisheries.
Assessments were obtained from 18 national and international
management institutions, with most coming from North America, Europe,
Australia, New Zealand and the high seas. Stocks present in the
database come from 31 Large Marine Ecosystems
and cover the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Mediterranean, Arctic and Antarctic
Ocean. Reference points were available or could be calculated for
about 74% of these stocks. The available
data provide new insight into the status of exploited populations,
57% of stocks with reference points
were estimated to be below <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$B_{msy}$"></SPAN>, and
29% had exploitation levels
estimated to be above <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$U_{msy}$"></SPAN>.  Assessed marine fish stocks comprise
a relatively small proportion of harvested taxa (24%), and an even
smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1%). We hope that
access to the database will facilitate new research into life
histories, population dynamics and the effects of fishing and
encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.

Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Marine wild capture fisheries provide more than 80 million tons of
fisheries products (both food and industrial) per year and employ 43.5
million people (wild capture and aquaculture, FAO:sofia).
At the same time, fishing has been recognized as having one of the
most widespread human impacts in the world's oceans
Halpern:etal:2008:science, and the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that two-thirds of
fish stocks globally are fully exploited or overexploited
FAO:sofia. While many fisheries have reduced exploitation
rates to levels that should in theory promote recovery, overfishing continues to
be a serious global problem Worm:etal:2009:science. Fishery
managers are asked to address multiple competing objectives, including
maximizing yields, ensuring profitability, reducing bycatch, and
minimizing the risk of overfishing. Given the large social and
economic costs Rice:etal:2003:icescm and ecosystem
consequences Frank:etal:2005:science, Myers:etal:2007:science
of collapsed fisheries, it is imperative that we are able to quickly
learn from successful and failed fisheries from around the world.

<P>
Effective management of exploited fish populations generally requires
an understanding of where the current size and harvest rate lie in
relation to the size and rate which maximize fishery benefits or limit
the risk of overfishing. This process of quantitative determination of
stock status and estimation of reference points is called stock
assessment. Some fisheries in developing countries have apparently
provided sustainable yields for long periods of time without formal
stock assessment (e.g. many community-managed fisheries in Oceania;
[<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-SUBMISSION-August-2010.html#Dalzell:1998:coastmgmt">51998Dalzell</A>]). This sustainability has been achieved
by limiting harvest rates, often through gear restrictions or seasonal
and area closures. In modern industrialized fisheries, however, where
fishing capacity often exceeds the productivity of fished stocks,
stock assessment is an integral component of responsible management
Hilborn:Walters:1992.

<P>
The global databases of fishery landings compiled by
[<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-SUBMISSION-August-2010.html#FAO:fishstat">112009aFAO</A>] and extended by the Sea Around Us project
Watson:etal:2004:fandf have proven to be valuable resources
for understanding the status of fisheries worldwide; however, catch
data alone can be misleading when used as a proxy for stock size.
Many papers have used these data to examine changes in fishery status
Worm:etal:2006:science, Costello:etal:2008:science, including
changes in trophic level Pauly:etal:1998,
  Essington:etal:2006:procnatacadsci, Newton:etal:2007:currentbiol.
Most of these analyses rely (either explicitly or implicitly) on the
assumption that catch or landings is a reliable index of stock size.
Critics have pointed out that catch can change for a number of reasons
unrelated to stock size, including changes in targeting, fishing
restrictions, or market preferences deMutsert:etal:2008:pnas,
 Murawski:Methot:Tromble:2007:science, Hilborn:2007:science,
 Caddy:etal:1998:science. Standardizing catch by the amount of
fishing effort (catch-per-unit-of-effort, CPUE) is an improvement,
particularly when these data are modeled to account for spatial,
temporal, and operational factors affecting the CPUE
Maunder:punt:2004:fishres, but CPUE can still be an unreliable
index of relative abundance since it is difficult to account for all
relevant factors Hutchings:Myers:1994:cjfas,
 Harley:etal:2001:cjfas, Walters:2003:cjfas, Polacheck:2006:marpol.

<P>
Stock assessments consider time series of catch along with other
sources of information such as: natural mortality rates, changes in
size or age composition, stock-recruitment relationships, and CPUE
coming from different fisheries and/or from fishery-independent surveys.
Because they integrate across multiple sources of information, stock
assessment models should provide a more accurate picture of
changes in abundance than catch data alone
Sibert:etal:2006:science, the trade-off being that their complexity
renders them difficult for non-experts to evaluate. Without a current and
comprehensive database of stock assessments, however scientists wishing to
conduct comparative analyses of marine fish population dynamics and
fishery status have little choice but to use problematic catch data.

<P>
The first global database of stock assessment information, the Myers
Stock Recruitment Database, was developed by the late Ransom A. Myers
and colleagues in the mid-1990s Myers:etal:1995:summary.
While the database was primarily known for its time series of stock
and recruitment, it did contain time series of fishing mortality rates
for many stocks; biological reference points were however largely
absent. The original release version of the Myers database
Myers:etal:1995:summary included spawning stock size and
recruitment time series for 274 stocks representing 92 species as well
as fishing mortality rates time series for 144 stocks. The number of
entered stocks grew to approximately 642 stocks (509 with at least one
SR pair) by 2005. Note that anadromous fishes
of the family Salmonidae comprised 290 assessments in the original
database. The assessment results collated by Dr. Myers were used to:

...lborn:1997:csiro,
Hutchings:2001:cjfas, Hutchings:2001:jfishb} \end{inparaenum}">
<BR>.

<P>
Although the original Myers database Myers:etal:1995:summary
was critical for motivating comparative analyses in fisheries science,
most of the stocks are now 15 years out of date.  For stocks that were
depleted in 1995, the past 15 years include valuable observations at
low stock size or of a recovering population, both of which are
critical for estimating population dynamics parameters such as the
behaviour of the stock-recruitment relationship near the origin. In
addition, there have been numerous improvements in stock assessment
methodologies (including important advances in statistical
catch-at-age and catch-at-length models) and assessments have been
conducted for the first time for many species.

<P>
Meta-analyses of fishery status also have been hampered by the
lack of a global assessment database containing biological reference
points (BRPs, e.g., the total/spawning biomass and fishing mortality rate that
produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$B_{MSY}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$F_{MSY}$"></SPAN>).  Knowledge of BRPs
is important if stocks are to be managed for high yields that can be
sustained over time Mace:1994:cjfas.  Without information on
reference points, previous analyses of stock assessments or catch data
have instead relied upon non-biological thresholds to define fishery
status, such as the greatest 15-year decline
Hutchings:Reynolds:2004:biosci or 10 percent of maximum catch
Worm:etal:2006:science. Ad hoc reference points based on some
fraction of the maximum of a time series also have undesirable
statistical properties and can result in false collapses when applied
to inherently variable time series of catch or abundance
Wilberg:Miller:2007:science, branch:2008:marpol.  Complicating
comparisons of fishery status is the fact that different BRPs are used
in different parts of the world and even the same BRP can be used in a
different manner, for example, as a target or as a limit. 

<P>
Here we present a new global database of stock assessments for
commercially exploited marine fish populations.  The database is an
update and extension of that developed by Ransom A. Myers, and is named
the RAM Legacy database in honour of his pioneering contribution.  This
effort is the first global stock assessment database to:

<OL>
<LI>Use a formal relational database structure;
</LI>
<LI>Use source control software to organise release versions;
</LI>
<LI>Include metadata related to the geographic location of the stock, the type of assessment model used, and the original source document for the assessment data;
</LI>
<LI>Include biological reference points, in addition to stock-specific life history information. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We use the new RAM Legacy database (Version 1.0, 2010) to evaluate the
knowledge-base for commercially exploited marine populations in terms
of institutional contributions, geography, taxonomy, ecology,
timespan, stock assessment methodologies and BRPs. We compare the
database's taxonomic coverage to that of global fisheries catches and to
global fish diversity. We then evaluate the status of assessed stocks
globally, and by management body, referencing all stocks to a
comparable benchmark. Finally, we discuss biases in the knowledge base
for assessed marine species, highlight potential applications of the
database, point out its caveats and limitations, and outline
directions for future development.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000">
The RAM Legacy database</A>
</H2>
The RAM Legacy database is a global relational database designed and
developed to store data from all current and accessible population
dynamics model-based fisheries stock assessments for marine fish and
invertebrate populations. Time series of spawning stock biomass (SSB),
total biomass (TB), recruits (R), total catch (TC) or landings (TL),
and fishing mortality (F) from individual stock assessments form the
core of the database.  Apart from catch/landings, these time series
are not raw data, but rather the output of population dynamics models;
depending on the type of assessment model not all of these time series
were available for every stock. The database also contains details
about the time series data, including the age and sex of spawners, age
of recruits, and the ages used to compute the fishing mortality, as
well as BRPs and some life history information (e.g. growth
parameters, age and length at 50% maturity and natural mortality rate).
Metadata for each stock assessment consists of taxonomic information
about the species and the geographic location of the stock (detailed in
``Links to related databases''), the management body that conducted
the assessment, the assessment methodology, the reference for the
stock assessment document, the name of the recorder entering the
assessment data, and the date the assessment was entered.  Some
assessments, particularly those for invertebrates, were based only on
CPUE time series rather than population dynamics models. While we
included these in the database (n=26), the database description and
analyses presented here focus on those stocks assessed using
population dynamics models.

<P>
Over the past two and a half years, we have employed a variety of
search methods in an attempt to obtain all recent fisheries stock
assessments.  Publicly available stock assessment reports available
from the internet were the primary data source.  These reports were
obtained either from the website of the relevant management agency or
directly from stock assessment scientists.  Other assessments were
obtained from the primary literature and through personal contacts at
fisheries management agencies.  Significant contributions were made by
many members of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis (NCEAS) working group ``Finding common ground in marine
conservation and management''. Relevant assessment data were first
transferred into a standardized spreadsheet template by a number of
recorders, including ourselves, assessment authors, our NCEAS
collaborators, and associated graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, and then uploaded into the relational database.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
Database structure and advantages</A>
</H2>
The database is implemented in the Open Source PostgreSQL relational
database management system (RDBMS) postgresql:2009, and includes tables for the assessment metadata,
time series values, time series units, and biometrics (a catch-all term
for data, such as life history characteristics or BRPs, that are not
part of a time series). The entity relationship diagram of the database and its component tables can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

<P>
RDBMSs form the server back-end to many applications of
interest to ecologists, including web-clients and GIS software, and
have a number of advantages over spreadsheet or flat text file data
compilations.  First, housing stock assessments in an RDBMS allows
multiple users to concurrently access and extract subsets of data in
an efficient and reproducible manner. Second, with the development of
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow analytical
software to directly communicate and extract data from the database,
a common data environment is established, independent of one's choice
of analytical software (e.g., SAS:SAS ACCESS, Matlab: Matlab/Database,
R:RDBI/RODBC, Perl:DBI, etc.).  Users familiar with Structured Query
Language (SQL) can also query the database directly from their
analytical software of choice and the same SQL query will extract the
same data through each of these applications.  Third, data products
tailored to specific projects can be generated and stored as dynamic
(i.e., continually updated) ``views'' within the database.  These are
typically rectangular, spreadsheet-like results of an expansive query
of the relevant tables that can be readily read into all commonly-used
analytical software.  The use of views is advantageous over
manipulating spreadsheets or flat text files for importing into a
specific analytic software, which runs the risk of losing data
integrity (e.g. multiple copies) and becomes impractical with large,
non-tabular datasets and multiple users.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
Data integrity and quality control</A>
</H2>
We have employed several mechanisms to ensure that the database is of
high quality. During the data recording process, assessment authors
often were contacted to clarify aspects of the assessment or to obtain
more detailed data. Time series data presented only in assessment
report figures were, for example, only entered into the database if
the exact numbers could be obtained from the assessment or its
authors. In cases where multiple models were presented in an
assessment without a preferred or&nbsp;best&nbsp; model being denoted, we
attempted to ascertain which model was preferred by the stock
assessment scientist, but included all model results whenever this was
not possible.  Once uploaded into the database all stock assessments
underwent an additional&nbsp;Quality Assurance/Quality Control&nbsp; (QA/QC)
step, to ensure that the entered data replicated that of the original
assessment document exactly. This process consisted of creating a
QA/QC summary document for each assessment, containing summary details
of the stock, a selection of biometrics and ratios for comparison
(e.g. current status relative to BRP), and time series plots of the
biomass, recruitment, and exploitation trajectories. QA/QC documents
were then returned to assessment recorders and an electronic trail of
subsequent correspondence was captured using a bug tracking system.
Recorders were responsible for checking, and where necessary
correcting, their QA/QC documents, after which all corrections were
transmitted back to the operational database and a quality controlled
flag was inserted to signify the assessment had passed the check. Only
assessments that have passed this QA/QC step are available for
subsequent analyses.

Links to related databases</A>
</H2>

<P>
To facilitate integration of the RAM Legacy database with related
databases, such as Fishbase Froese:Pauly:2009:fishbase and the
Sea Around Us Project's (SAUP) global landings database
Watson:etal:2004:fandf, each species present in the RAM Legacy
database was assigned a matching FishBase species name and species
code, a matching SAUP taxon code, and taxonomic information from the
Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) (http://www.itis.gov).
Additionally, each stock was assigned to a primary (and in some cases
secondary and tertiary) Large Marine Ecosystem (LME)
NOAA:LME64:1998.  LMEs encompass the continental shelves of
the world's oceans and represent the most productive areas of the
oceans.  Open ocean areas beyond the continental shelves are, however,
not included in the LME classification. Large, highly migratory
oceanic species such as tuna were therefore assigned to new categories
``Atlantic high seas'', ``Pacific high seas'', ``Indian high seas'',
and ``Subantarctic high seas''.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00035000000000000000">
Assessing the knowledge-base for commercially exploited stocks</A>
</H2>
Any collection of data necessarily provides an incomplete picture of
the marine ecosystem. To provide insight into the scope of the
database we assessed the knowledge-base for commercially exploited
stocks, as represented by the RAM Legacy database, with a variety of
metrics. Such an analysis is essential to ensure that users recognise
appropriate applications of the data and the caveats that must be
considered when interpreting their analyses.

<P>
To evaluate the taxonomic scope of the database, we compare
the taxonomy of assessed stocks with the diversity of i) all marine
fishes (as represented by FishBase), and ii) marine fishes in global
fisheries catches (as represented by the species available from the
SAUP database), and discuss taxonomic biases in species included in
catch data and in populations assessed with stock assessments. We
overview the types of assessment models used, and BRPs estimated, for
all stock assessments and by management body. To determine what
fraction of world wild-capture fisheries landings come from assessed
stocks, we used the SAUP's average global fisheries catches from the
most recent ten years of available data (1995-2004); we also discuss
limitations to obtaining assessments for some of the world's major
fisheries.  Comparisons between assessments and catch data at a
regional level are hampered by the geographic mismatch between stocks
and FAO statistical areas or the SAUP's Large Marine Ecosystems.

In total, 324 recent stock assessments for
288 marine fish and 36
invertebrate populations are included in the RAM Legacy database
(Version 1.0, 2010; Table S1). Together these comprise time series of
catch/landings for 307 stocks (95%),
SSB estimates for 274 stocks (85%), and recruitment estimates for
270 stocks (83%) (Table S1).

Management bodies and geography</A>
</H3>
Stock assessments are derived from fisheries management bodies in
Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Russia,
South Africa and Argentina (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#tab:mgmt">1</A>). Also included are
assessments conducted by eight Regional Fisheries Management
Organizations (RFMOs), in the Northwest Atlantic, Atlantic, Pacific
and Indian Ocean (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#tab:mgmt">1</A>). Assessments from the United
States constitute by far the most stocks of any country or region
(n=139); assessments from the European Union's
management body, the International Council for the Exploration of the
Seas (ICES), constitute the the second greatest number of stocks
(n=63).  Whereas nations are responsible for
managing all populations within their EEZs, RFMOs typically focus on a
certain type of species (e.g.  halibut, tunas) or fisheries (e.g.
pelagic high seas) within a given area and hence assess a smaller
number of stocks.

<P>
Most assessments come from North America, Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and the high seas, while there are few from regions such as
Southeast Asia, South America, and the Indian Ocean (outside
Australian waters) (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:lmes">1</A>). Assessments were available for 31 LMEs, with the greatest number of
assessed stocks coming from Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=58),
California Current (n=35), New Zealand Shelf (n=29),
Gulf of Alaska (n=26), Celtic-Biscay Shelf (n=26), East Bering Sea (n=22)

Assessments for 159 species from
57 families and 20
orders are included in the database (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:srdb">2</A>). Five
taxonomic orders (Gadiformes (n=67),
Perciformes (n=62), Pleuronectiformes (n=53),
Scorpaeniformes (n=40) and Clupeiformes (n=36)) account for
80% of available stock assessments.  Of these, Perciformes, the most
speciose Order of marine fishes are in fact underrepresented in the
database (46% of all marine fish species vs.  19% of all marine
fish assessments), while the other four orders are
taxonomically overrepresented: Clupeiformes (2.1% of marine fishes
vs.  11% in the database), Gadiformes (3.3% of marine fishes vs.
21% in the database), Pleuronectiformes (4.5% of marine fishes vs.
17% in the database), Scorpaeniformes (8.5% of marine fishes vs.
12% in the database) (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>).

<P>
Assessed marine fish stocks in the RAM Legacy database constitute a
relatively small proportion of harvested taxa
(24% of fish species from the SAUP database)
and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity
(1% of fish species in FishBase;
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>). In turn, catches from the SAUP

36 orders (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>),
represent only 5% of the
12339 species and 67%
of the 54 different orders present in FishBase
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>). The diversity of harvested marine
invertebrates is clearly underrepresented in the stock assessment

<P>
The three most common assessment methods were
Statistical catch-at-age/length models (n=164), Virtual Population Analyses (n=91) and

(VPA) is still the most common assessment model for European stocks
(71% of 63 assessments),
Canada (59% of 22

<P>
Biomass- or exploitation-based reference points were available for
256 (81%) and
221 (69%)

BRPs relate to biomass at MSY (e.g. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

The knowledge-base and status of commercially exploited marine stocks</A>
</H2>
The RAM Legacy Database provides detailed time series and point data
from available stock assessments for the world's industrial marine
fisheries, thus providing a basis for evaluating the existing
knowledge-base and current status of these fisheries. Accessible stock
assessments are predominantly from developed nations in
north-temperate regions, and tend to cover only the past few decades,
typically a significantly shorter period than that for which the stock
has been exploited. The taxonomic makeup of available assessments is a
very limited subset of the accepted taxonomic coverage of marine
species worldwide, and of globally exploited species. Most notably
(with the exception of tunas), assessments are not
available for coral reef and other tropical fishes. Inshore (e.g.
estuarine species) and anadramous populations are also noteworthy in
their absence (as a result of our focus on federally or
internationally managed marine species) and, as such, any assessment
of global status of exploited populations must be interpreted only for
that subset of exploited species for which assessments are present in
the database.

<P>
In its latest State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture
FAO:sofia, the FAO reports that 20% of stocks are
underexploited, 52% are fully exploited, 19% are overexploited, 8%
are depleted and 1% are recovering. While direct comparison with
these categories is difficult, we estimate that almost 60% of
assessed stocks are below the biomass reference point that maximises
their yield. Almost half of stocks that are below <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$B_{msy}$"></SPAN> still
experience exploitation rates that are above those that would maximise

Biases in the knowledge-base for commercially exploited marine stocks</A>
</H2>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052100000000000000">
Geographic bias</A>
</H3>
Bias in the geographic scope of the RAM Legacy database (relative to
that of all fisheries globally) may arise for several reasons, all of
which vary geographically in their prevalence: 1. an assessment is not
conducted on a stock; 2. it is not possible to access the assessment;
or 3. the non-exhaustive collation we undertook overlooked the
assessment. Whether an assessment is conducted for a given stock
depends upon a multitude of factors, including the economic value of
the stock, the availability of fiscal resources to collect the data
required for an assessment (which frequently includes conducting
fisheries-independent research surveys) and the expertise to conduct
assessments. In general, conducting stock assessments is a costly
endeavour that is restricted to wealthy fishing nations. The legal
context where fisheries are prosecuted can also strongly influence the
requirement for conducting stock assessments. In the United States,
the Magnuson-Stevens Act defines which stocks are to be monitored and
managed, hence a large number of the assessments in the RAM Legacy
database are under the jurisdiction of the US National Marine
Fisheries Services. How accessible assessments are for entry depends
upon the transparency and access policies of the relevant management
agencies, which also varies geographically. Our search for assessments
could also give rise to geographic biases, as concerted collation
efforts have only been conducted in those known assessment-rich
regions. It is hoped that readers of this article can assist in
correcting these biases by participating in future updates of the RAM
Legacy database, in particular, by helping to expand our coverage of
stocks in developing countries.

<P>
Even in developed countries, however, not all stocks are assessed. For
example, in 2007, of the 528 fish and invertebrate stocks recognized
by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), only 179, or slightly
over one-third, were fully assessed NMFS:2008:status. An
assessment by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2006 indicated
that the percentage of commercial landings obtained from assessed
stocks ranged between 66-97 percent in northern European waters and
30-77 percent in the Mediterranean eea:2009:status. The New
Zealand Ministry of Fisheries reports the status of 117 stocks or
sub-stocks out of a total of 628 stocks managed under New Zealand's
Quota Management System NZMF:2009. In Australia, 98 federally
managed stocks have been assessed Wilson:etal:2009:status out
of an unknown total. The extent to which stocks are assessed elsewhere
in the world is generally lower Mora:etal:2009:PLoSBiol.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052200000000000000">
Taxonomic bias</A>
</H3>
Related to geographic bias is the taxonomic bias in those species that
are known, caught and assessed. At a broad level the Gadiformes and
Clupeiformes occupy disproportionate taxonomic representation in the
catch compared to overall species occurrence
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>, panels a and b). Taxonomic biases
at this level may reflect behavioural tendencies of the
over-represented species in the catch to form large aggregated
populations in temperate regions that are readily accessible to
fishing. Consumer preferences may also be an important determinant of
what taxonomic groups are more likely to be caught.  The
over-representation of the Gadiformes and, to a lesser degree, the
Clupeiformes, continues when caught and assessed taxa are compared
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>, panels b and c). Historical
economic importance as well as the geographic distribution of the taxa
in relation to mandated assessments may play important roles in
determining what fished taxa are assessed.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052300000000000000">
Temporal bias</A>
</H3>
Most of the assessments in the RAM Legacy database contain time series
of 30 years or less whereas industrial fishing began long before this.
Dominant age-structured assessment methodologies typically rely on
catch-at-age data, which are often available for considerably shorter
periods of time than total catch unless significant reconstruction
efforts are made.  Such historical reconstructions of catch-at-age
data are highly uncertain and in many cases the ``base case'' models
used for management are based only on more reliable recent catch data.
For assessments used in a tactical sense and for short-term
projection, e.g., to understand whether a particular quota level will
result in an increase or decrease in stock size, using only reliable
recent catch data may be preferable.  This is particularly true for
backward projection methods (e.g., VPA), which may converge on
parameter estimates within the more reliable recent period and
potentially benefit little from reaching further back in time.
Nevertheless, a focus on only the recent history of a fishery can be
seriously misleading for strategic decisions about goals and BRPs.
Put simply, if we do not know what's historically possible (in terms of
stock size), it's hard to know where we should set our goals.  This
``shifting baseline'' problem has been widely recognized
Pauly:1995:tree, SaenzArroyo:etal::2005:procB, but is still apparent in the
relatively short time series of most assessments.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052400000000000000">
Future applications of the RAM Legacy database</A>
</H3>
We anticipate that this new database will be of utility for fisheries
scientists, ecologists, and marine conservation biologists interested
in conducting comparative analyses of global fisheries status,
collapse and recovery patterns, fisheries productivity or marine
population dynamics. In addition to the initial aim of providing
reliable access to time series information about stocks, we hope to
also stimulate research in the relationships of life-history
characteristics and their relation to exploitation. The RAM Legacy
database contains the corresponding species codes to the Sea Around Us
Project and FishBase, thus facilitating researchers' use of a global
fisheries data ``toolkit'' to address questions on the relationships
between life history attributes and resulting population dynamics in
an exploited setting.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052500000000000000">
Caveats and limitations</A>
</H3>

<P>
Stock assessment outputs (e.g. biomass time series), which constitute
the majority of the new RAM Legacy database are model estimates, not
raw data. The uncertainty associated with these estimates should be
carried forth in subsequent analyses. Although the database structure
allows for inclusion of estimates of uncertainty (standard errors,
95% credible/confidence intervals), uncertainty estimates for time
series data were typically missing from assessments and hence were not
included in the database. As with any analysis, clearer inference on
the strength of a signal is available when all uncertainty in the data
is carried forth.

<P>
BRPs derived from surplus production models are to be interpreted with
great care. For stocks with both assesment-derived and
Schaefer-derived BRPs, we found that estimates from surplus production
models were systematically higher than those obtained from
assessments. This discrepancy stems from the fact that in the Schaefer
surplus production model, MSY occurs at 50% of the carrying capacity
whereas in most age-based assessment models, yield is maximised at a
lower fraction of the carrying capacity. The more flexible
Pella-Tomlinson surplus production model allows for an asymmetric
production function where MSY can occur at a wider range of relative
biomass.  Pella-Tomlinson models provided a better fit to data from
individual stocks, which is to be expected given their greater
flexibility and the inclusion of an additional parameter, however they
performed no better in cross-validation than did the Schaefer model.

<P>
The original database developed by Ransom A. Myers was used to address
a variety of ecological questions derived from stock-recruit
relationships. This synthesis was possible because the VPA-type
assessment models that constituted most of that database generated time
series of stock and recruitment with relatively few a priori
assumptions.  Forward projection methods generally specify the form of
the stock-recruit relationship, and in many cases even fix parameters
(infinitely dense point prior) such as steepness.  Stock-recruitment
``data'' from such models, are clearly inappropriate for
straightforward meta-analysis. In general, as more assessments
incorporate some type of prior information from other stocks or
species Hilborn:Liermann:1998:reviews, there is less
stock-specific information available for future meta-analysis
Minte-Vera:etal:2005:cjfas.  One solution is for stock
assessments to report not only best estimates of parameters based on
all available data, but also stock-specific parameter estimates that
do not incorporate prior information from other stocks or species.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00052600000000000000">
Future development</A>
</H3>

<P>
New stocks will continue to be added to the RAM Legacy database,
particularly freshwater and anadramous populations (the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Salmonidae</SPAN> constituted 45% of the stocks in the original Myers
Stock Recruitment Database), and updated assessments for already
included stocks. We hope that future versions of the database will
also include timelines of management actions per stock, as well as
age-varying and length-varying data such as maturity ogives and
age-disaggregated natural mortality. Depending on availability,
subsequent releases of the database could also include estimates of
assessment uncertainty.  Future database products will include
management-agency-level reports containing summaries of all stocks
within their remit.  The development of a standard for assessment
reporting at the management agency level would greatly assist in the
acquisition of new assessments, and hence to ensure that the database
remains current.  For example, ICES assessments have a very regular
standard, including agreed-upon reference points and regular estimate
reporting. This makes the process of data collation much more routine
than unstandardized documents where the recorder trawls through a
report for the relevant information. ICES also has a central database
of assessments for stocks of the region. Certainly different stocks
and regions require different formats but basic output tables,
consisting of total and spawning biomass, recruitment, catch/landings,
estimated fishing mortality over vulnerable age groups, associated
measures of uncertainty, and commonly-used reference points would
streamline the process immensely. A process whereby the assessment
spreadsheets are filled out at each assessment meeting would
facilitate the process even further and be the least error prone
method. In return, the assessment scientists can access results for a
global collation of assessments to further their own research
initiatives in population assessment and management. The ultimate goal
is to provide a comprehensive stock assessment database for
researchers to use results from multiple regions to assist in their
own applied and fundamental research in population ecology, fisheries
science, and conservation biology.

Figure 1. Global map of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) and
high seas areas (ovals) showing the number of stock assessments present in the database for each area.

Figure 2. Taxonomic coverage of assessed marine species present in the
RAM Legacy database. The circle located near the middle of the circular
dendrogram represents kingdom Animalia and each subsequent branching
represents a different taxonomic group (Kingdom to Phylum to Class to
Order to Family to Genus to Species). The width of each line is
proportional to the square root of the number of assessments in the
database. The outermost lines represent species and the number of
lines is the number of assessments for each species. The names of
multi-assessment species are not repeated on the outermost portion of
the dendrogram but continue counter-clockwise from the first entry.
Note that branch lengths are chosen for graphical purposes and do not
convey phylogenetic distance.

<P>
Figure 3. Comparison of the taxonomic diversity of marine
species as provided by FishBase (top panel), the coverage of catch
data as provided by the Sea Around Us Project (SAUP) database (middle
panel) and the new RAM Legacy database (bottom panel). To facilitate the
identification of the taxonomic groups that are not presented in the catch
and assessment data, the FishBase branching pattern of the spoked dendrogram is
maintained to generate the other two dendrograms.
<BR>
<P>
Figure 4. Orca plots showing the temporal coverage of (A)
catch/landings, (B) spawning stock biomass and (C) recruitment. The
temporal coverage for individual assessments is represented by thin
alternating black and grey horizontal lines in the main panels. Orca
plots are named because their distinctive shape is uncannily similar
to the individually-identifiable nicked and notched dorsal fins of
killer whales (orcas). Thick horizontal lines at the base of each main
panel represent the time periods which are present in 90% (black) and
50% (grey) of all series for that data type.  Subfigure histograms
contain the frequency of occurrence of the various timespans without
reference to time period. Solid and long-dash vertical lines within
the subfigures represent the median,
2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, respectively.

should allow maximum sustainable yield (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
