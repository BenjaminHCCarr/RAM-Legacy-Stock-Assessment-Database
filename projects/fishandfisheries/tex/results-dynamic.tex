\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Scope of the RAM Legacy database}
In total, 324 recent stock assessments for
288 marine fish and 36
invertebrate populations are included in the RAM Legacy database
(Version 1.0, 2010).

\subsubsection*{Management bodies and geography}
The database includes stocks assessed by fisheries management bodies
in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Russia,
South Africa and Argentina (Table~\ref{tab:mgmt}). Also included are assessments
conducted by eight Regional Fisheries Management Organizations
(RFMOs), in the Northwest Atlantic, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean
(Table~\ref{tab:mgmt}). Assessments from the United States comprise by far the most
stocks of any country or region (n=139);
assessments from the European Union's management body ICES comprise
the the second greatest number of stocks (n=63).
Whereas nations are responsible for managing all populations within
their EEZs, RFMOs typically focus on a certain type of species (e.g.
halibut, tunas) or fisheries (e.g. pelagic high seas) within a given
area and hence assess a smaller number of stocks.

Most assessments come from North America, Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and the High Seas, while few are entered from regions such as
Southeast Asia, South America, and the Indian Ocean (outside
Australian waters) (Figure~\ref{fig:lmes}). Assessments were available for 31 LMEs, with the greatest number of
assessed stocks coming from Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=58),
California Current (n=35), New Zealand Shelf (n=29),
Gulf of Alaska (n=26), Celtic-Biscay Shelf (n=26), East Bering Sea (n=22)
and Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=20) (Figure~\ref{fig:lmes}).

%Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=88), the California Current (n=35, the East Bering Sea (n=32), the New Zealand Shelf (n=29), the Gulf of Alaska (n=28), the Celtic-Biscay Shelf (n=24) and the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf (n=21)

\subsubsection*{Taxonomy}

157 species from
57 families and 20
orders are included in the database (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:srdb}). Five
taxonomic orders (Gadiformes (n=67),
Perciformes (n=62), Pleuronectiformes (n=53),
Scorpaeniformes (n=41) and Clupeiformes (n=36)) account for
80\% of available stock assessments.  Of these, Perciformes, the
most speciose Order of marine fishes are in fact underrepresented in
the database (46.04\% of all marine fish species vs.  19\%
of all marine fish assessments), while it is the other four orders
that are taxonomically overrepresented: Clupeiformes (2.1\% of marine
fishes vs.  11\% in the database), Gadiformes (3.3\% of marine fishes
vs.  21\% in the database), Pleuronectiformes (4.5\% of marine fishes
vs.  17\% in the database), Scorpaeniformes (8.5\% of marine fishes
vs. 12\% in the database) (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}).

Assessed marine fish stocks in the RAM Legacy database comprise a
relatively small proportion of harvested taxa (24\% of fish species
from the SAUP database) and an even smaller proportion of marine fish
biodiversity (1\% of fish species in FishBase;
Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}). In turn, catches from the SAUP
database, which come from 649 species and
36 orders (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}),
represent only 5\% of the 12339 species and 67\% of
the 54 different orders present in FishBase
(Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}).

\subsubsection*{Timespan }

Of the 324 stock assessments, time series data of
catch/landings were available for 308 stocks (95\%),
of SSB for 271 stocks (84\%), and of recruitment for
269 stocks (83\%).  The median lengths of
catch/landings, SSB, and recruitment timeseries were
38, 34, and 33 years,
respectively.  The time period covered by 90\%
of assessments is: catch/landings (1967-2007), SSB (1972-2007), recruitment
(1971-2006), while that covered by 50\% of assessments is: catch/landings
(1983-2004), SSB (1985-2005), recruitment (1984-2003) (Figure~\ref{fig:orca}).

\subsubsection*{Stock assessment methodologies and BRPs}
In addition to the 324 assessments in the
database, indices of relative abundance from scientific surveys are
available for an additional 26 stocks. The
three most common assessment methods were Statistical catch-at-age/length models (n=164),
Virtual Population Analyses (n=90) and Biomass dynamics model (n=45)..  .....Need
to add a sentence here about the regional differences.... .


The total number and percentage of assessments that reported biomass-
or exploitation- based reference points of any sort was
257 (81\%) and
222 (69\%),
respectively. From these assessments,
66 report both a biomass-based and an
exploitation-based BRP and appear as solid dots on
Figures~\ref{fig:friedegg} and ~\ref{fig:friedeggmgmt}. Schaefer-derived BRPs
add an additional 174 assessments, for
a total of 240 assessments used to generate
Figure~\ref{fig:friedegg}. Overall,
58\% of assessed stocks are below
their biomass-related MSY BRP and
30\% are above their
exploitation-related MSY BRP. Different management bodies have
different overall status of current biomass to BRPs
(Figure~\ref{fig:friedeggmgmt}).

\subsubsection*{Ecology}
Assessed species span a range of ecological traits. In terms of their
trophic level, we see XXX (Figure~\ref{fig:TL}). The total number and
percentage of assessments that reported any life-history information
(growth, maturity, fecundity) was 288.
