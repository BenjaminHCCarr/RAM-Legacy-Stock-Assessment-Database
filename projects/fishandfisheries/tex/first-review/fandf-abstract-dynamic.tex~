\section*{Abstract}

Assessments were assembled for REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSMENT stocks
(REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSFISH fish species representing
REF:SQL:TOTNUMFISHFAMILIES families, and REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSINVERT
invertebrate species representing REF:SQL:TOTNUMINVERTFAMILIES
families). Assessments were obtained from REF:SQL:TOTNUMMGMT national
and international management institutions. Stocks
present in the database come from REF:SQL:TOTNUMLMESPRIMARY Large
Marine Ecosystems. Assessed marine fish stocks
comprise a relatively small proportion of harvested taxa
(REF:SQL:SRDBPERCENTSPPSAUP\%), and an even smaller proportion of
marine fish biodiversity (REF:SQL:SRDBPERCENTSPPFISHBASE\%). Reference
points were available or could be calculated for about
REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSFRIEDEGG\% of these stocks. The available data
provide new insight into the status of exploited populations,
REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSMENTSBELOWBMSY\% of stocks with reference points
were estimated to be below $B_{msy}$, and
REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSMENTSABOVEFMSY\% had exploitation levels
estimated to be above $U_{msy}$. Temporal coverage of assessments is
recent with 90\% of catch time-series ranging REF:SQL:CATCHTIMESPAN90
and 90\% of biomass time-series ranging REF:SQL:SSBTIMESPAN90.
