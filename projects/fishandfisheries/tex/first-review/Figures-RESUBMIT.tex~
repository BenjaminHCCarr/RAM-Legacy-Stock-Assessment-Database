\noindent Figure 1. Map of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) and
high seas areas (ovals) showing the number of stock assessments
present in the database for each area. This map illustrates the limited
spatial coverage of available stock assessments.\\

\noindent Figure 2. Taxonomic coverage of assessed marine species present in the
RAM Legacy database. The circle located near the middle of the circular
dendrogram represents kingdom Animalia and each subsequent branching
represents a different taxonomic group (Kingdom to Phylum to Class to
Order to Family to Genus to Species). The width of each line is
proportional to the square root of the number of assessments in the
database. The outermost lines represent species and the number of
lines is the number of assessments for each species. The names of
multi-assessment species are not repeated on the outermost portion of
the dendrogram but continue counter-clockwise from the first entry.
Note that branch lengths are chosen for graphical purposes and do not
convey phylogenetic distance.\\ 

\noindent Figure 3. Comparison of the taxonomic diversity of marine
species as provided by FishBase (top panel), the coverage of catch
data as provided by the Sea Around Us database (middle panel) and the
new RAM Legacy database (bottom panel). To facilitate the
identification of the taxonomic groups that are not presented in the
catch and assessment data, the FishBase branching pattern of the
spoked dendrogram is maintained to generate the other two dendrograms.
This figure only compares fish and elasmobranch species present in
FishBase. Additonal species of molluscs and arthropods are present in
both the Sea Around Us and RAM Legacy databases but are not presented here.
\\

\noindent Figure 4. Orca plots showing the temporal coverage of (A)
catch/landings, (B) spawning stock biomass and (C) recruitment. The
temporal coverage for individual assessments is represented by thin
alternating black and grey horizontal lines in the main panels. Orca
plots are named because their distinctive shape is uncannily similar
to the individually-identifiable nicked and notched dorsal fins of
killer whales (orcas). Thick horizontal lines at the base of each main
panel represent the time periods which are present in 90\% (black) and
50\% (grey) of all series for that data type.  Subfigure histograms
contain the frequency of occurrence of the various timespans without
reference to time period. Solid and long-dash vertical lines within
the subfigures represent the median,
2.5\% and 97.5\% quantiles, respectively.\\

\noindent Figure 5. Current exploitation rate versus current biomass
for 213 individual stocks and for individual stocks grouped by
management unit. Exploitation is scaled relative to that which should
allow maximum sustainable yield ($U_{msy}$); biomass is scaled
relative to $B_{msy}$. Shades of grey indicate probability of
occurrence as revealed by a kernel density smooth function. Solid
circles indicate $B_{msy}$ and $U_{msy}$ that were obtained directly
from assessments; open circles indicate that they were estimated from
surplus production models. The panel labelled ``Atlantic'' includes
ICCAT and NAFO. This figure is an updated version of Fig 3B from
\citet{Worm:etal:2009:science}.
