\section*{Abstract}

Assessments were assembled for 331 stocks
(295 fish species representing
46 families, and 36
invertebrate species representing 12
families). Assessments were obtained from 21 national
and international management institutions. Stocks
present in the database come from 32 Large
Marine Ecosystems. Assessed marine fish stocks
comprise a relatively small proportion of harvested taxa
(18\%), and an even smaller proportion of
marine fish biodiversity (1\%). Reference
points were available or could be calculated for about
65\% of these stocks. The available data
provide new insight into the status of exploited populations,
59\% of stocks with reference points
were estimated to be below $B_{msy}$, and
30\% had exploitation levels
estimated to be above $U_{msy}$. Temporal coverage of assessments is
recent with 90\% of catch time-series ranging 1966-2007
and 90\% of biomass time-series ranging 1972-2007.
