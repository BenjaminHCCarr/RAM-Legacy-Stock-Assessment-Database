Taxonomic bias</A>
</H3>
Related to geographic bias is the taxonomic bias in those species that
are known, caught and assessed. At a broad level the Gadiformes and
Clupeiformes occupy disproportionate taxonomic representation in the
catch compared to overall species occurrence (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node34.html#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>, panels a and
b). Taxonomic biases at this level may reflect behavioural tendencies
of the over-represented species in the catch to form large aggregated
populations in temperate regions that are readily accessible to
fishing. Consumer preferences may also be an important determinant of
what taxonomic groups are more likely to be caught.  The
over-representation of the Gadiformes and, to a lesser degree, the
Clupeiformes, continues when caught and assessed taxa are compared
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node34.html#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>, panels b and c). 

<P>
Historical economic importance as well as
the geographic distribution of the taxa in relation to mandated
assessments may play important roles in determining what fished taxa
are assessed.  Even in developed countries, however, not all stocks
are assessed. For example, in 2007, of the 528 fish and invertebrate
stocks recognized by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
only 179, or slightly over one-third, were fully assessed NMFS:2008:status. An assessment by the European
Environment Agency (EEA) in 2006 indicated that the percentage of
commercial landings obtained from assessed stocks ranged between 66-97
percent in northern European waters and 30-77 percent in the
Mediterranean eea:2009:status. The New Zealand
Ministry of Fisheries reports the status of 117 stocks or sub-stocks
out of a total of 628 stocks managed under New Zealand's Quota
Management System NZMF:2009. In
Australia, 98 federally managed stocks have been assessed
Wilson:etal:2009:status out of an unknown total. The extent to
which stocks are assessed elsewhere in the world is currently unknown.
