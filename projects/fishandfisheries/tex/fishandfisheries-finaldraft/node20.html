The knowledge-base and status of commercially exploited marine stocks</A>
</H2>
The RAM Legacy Database provides detailed time series and point data
from available stock assessments for the world's industrial marine
fisheries, thus providing a basis for evaluating the existing
knowledge-base and current status of these fisheries. Accessible stock
assessments are predominantly from developed nations in
north-temperate regions, and tend to cover only the past few decades,
typically a significantly shorter period than that for which the stock
has been exploited. The taxonomic makeup of available assessments is a
very limited subset of the accepted taxonomic coverage of marine
species worldwide, and of globally exploited species. Most notably
(with the exception of tunas), assessments are not
available for coral reef and other tropical fishes. Inshore (e.g.
estuarine species) and anadramous populations are also noteworthy in
their absence (as a result of our focus on federally or
internationally managed marine species) and, as such, any assessment
of global status of exploited populations must be interpreted only for
that subset of exploited species for which assessments are present in
the database.

<P>
In its latest State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture
FAO:sofia, the FAO reports that 20% of stocks are
underexploited, 52% are fully exploited, 19% are overexploited, 8%
are depleted and 1% are recovering. The ambiguous
classification of stocks as ``underexploited'', ``fully exploited''
and ``overexploited'' makes comparisons of our results with those from
the FAO difficult. Our estimates are that almost 60% of stocks are
below the biomass reference point that maximises their yield. Almost
half of stocks that are below <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$B_{msy}$"></SPAN> still experience exploitation
rates that are above those that would maximise yield. Our results also
provide evidence that appropriate fisheries management measures can
curtail over-exploitation and that stocks can recover.  For depleted
stocks, recovery requires strongly articulated legislation,
potentially difficult short- to medium-term regulations to decrease
fishing mortality, protection of habitat through area closures and
recovery targets with well-defined timelines. For stocks that exist in
areas beyond national jurisdiction, nation members of various Regional
Fisheries Management Organisations must treat international
regulations as binding agreements that must be fulfilled.
