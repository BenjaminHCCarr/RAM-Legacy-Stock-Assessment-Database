New stocks will continue to be added to the RAM Legacy database,
particularly freshwater and anadramous populations (the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Salmonidae</SPAN> comprised 45% of the stocks in the original Myers
Stock Recruitment Database), and updated assessments for already
included stocks. Future versions of the database will also include
timelines of management actions per stock, as well as age-varying and
length-varying data such as maturity ogives and age-disaggregated
natural mortality. Depending on availability, subsequent releases of
the database could also include estimates of assessment uncertainty.
Future database products will include management-agency-level reports
containing summaries of all stocks within their remit.  The
development of a standard for assessment reporting at the management
agency level would greatly assist in the acquisition of new
assessments, and hence to ensure that the database remains current.
For example, ICES assessments have a very regular standard, including
agreed-upon reference points and regular estimate reporting. This
makes the process of data collation much more routine than
unstandardized documents where the recorder trawls through a report
for the relevant information. ICES also has a central database of
assessments for stocks of the region. Certainly different stocks and
regions require different formats but basic output tables, consisting
of total and spawning biomass, recruitment, catch/landings, estimated
fishing mortality over vulnerable age groups, associated measures of
uncertainty, and commonly-used reference points would streamline the
process immensely. A process whereby the assessment spreadsheets are
filled out at each assessment meeting would facilitate the process
even further and be the least error prone method. In return, the
assessment scientists can access results for a global collation of
assessments to further their own research initiatives in population
assessment and management. The ultimate goal is to provide a
comprehensive stock assessment database for researchers to use results
from multiple regions to assist in their own applied and fundamental
research in population ecology, fisheries science, and conservation
biology.
