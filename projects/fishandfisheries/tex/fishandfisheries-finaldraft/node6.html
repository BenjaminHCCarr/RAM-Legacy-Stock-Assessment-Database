Data integrity and quality control</A>
</H2>
We have employed several mechanisms to ensure that the database is of
high quality. During the data recording process, assessment authors
often were contacted to clarify aspects of the assessment or to obtain
more detailed data. Time series data presented only in assessment
report figures were, for example, only entered into the database if
the exact numbers could be obtained from the assessment or its
authors. In cases where multiple models were presented in an
assessment without a preferred or&nbsp;best&nbsp; model being denoted, we
attempted to ascertain which model was preferred by the stock
assessment scientist, but included all model results whenever this was
not possible.  Once uploaded into the database all stock assessments
underwent an additional&nbsp;Quality Assurance/Quality Control&nbsp; (QA/QC)
step, to ensure that the entered data replicated that of the original
assessment document exactly. This process consisted of creating a
QA/QC summary document for each assessment, containing summary details
of the stock, a selection of biometrics and ratios for comparison
(e.g. current status relative to BRP), and time series plots of the
biomass, recruitment, and exploitation trajectories. QA/QC documents
were then returned to assessment recorders and an electronic trail of
subsequent correspondence was captured using a bug tracking system.
Recorders were responsible for checking, and where necessary
correcting, their QA/QC documents, after which all corrections were
transmitted back to the operational database and a quality controlled
flag was inserted to signify the assessment had passed the check. Only
assessments that have passed this QA/QC step are available for
subsequent analyses.
