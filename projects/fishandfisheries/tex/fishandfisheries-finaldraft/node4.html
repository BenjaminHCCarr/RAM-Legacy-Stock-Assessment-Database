The RAM Legacy database</A>
</H2>
The RAM Legacy database is a global relational database designed and
developed to store data from all current and accessible population
dynamics model-based fisheries stock assessments for marine fish and
invertebrate populations. Time series of spawning stock biomass (SSB),
total biomass (TB), recruits (R), total catch (TC) or landings (TL),
and fishing mortality (F) from individual stock assessments form the
core of the database.  Apart from catch/landings, these time series
are not raw data, but rather the output of population dynamics models;
depending on the type of assessment model not all of these time series
were available for every stock. The database also contains details
about the time series data, including the age and sex of spawners, age
of recruits, and the ages used to compute the fishing mortality, as
well as BRPs and some life history information (e.g. growth
parameters, age and length at 50% maturity and natural mortality rate).
Metadata for each stock assessment consists of taxonomic information
about the species and the geographic location of the stock (detailed in
``Links to related databases''), the management body that conducted
the assessment, the assessment methodology, the reference for the
stock assessment document, the name of the recorder entering the
assessment data, and the date the assessment was entered.  Some
assessments, particularly those for invertebrates, were based only on
CPUE time series rather than population dynamics models. While we
included these in the database (n=26), the database description and
analyses presented here focus on those stocks assessed using
population dynamics models.

<P>
Over the past two and a half years, we have employed a variety of
search methods in an attempt to obtain all recent fisheries stock
assessments.  Publicly available stock assessment reports available
from the internet were the primary data source.  These reports were
obtained either from the website of the relevant management agency or
directly from stock assessment scientists.  Other assessments were
obtained from the primary literature and through personal contacts at
fisheries management agencies.  Significant contributions were made by
many members of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
Synthesis (NCEAS) working group ``Finding common ground in marine
conservation and management''. Relevant assessment data were first
transferred into a standardized spreadsheet template by a number of
recorders, including ourselves, assessment authors, our NCEAS
collaborators, and associated graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers, and then uploaded into the relational database.
