Caveats and limitations</A>

<P>
Stock assessment outputs (e.g. biomass time series), which comprise the
majority of the new RAM Legacy database are model estimates, not raw
data. The uncertainty associated with these estimates should be
carried forth in subsequent analyses. Although the database structure
allows for inclusion of estimates of uncertainty (standard errors,
95% credible/confidence intervals), because these estimates were
typically missing from assessments, either because they weren't
produced by the assessment model (e.g. non-bootstrapped VPA
assessments) or the focus of the assessment document was on central
tendency (e.g. mean biomass) not the associated uncertainty, they have
not been included in this first version of the database. Note that
this view of assessment uncertainty is changing with the advent of
MCMC approaches to Bayesian inference for assessments, bootstrap
methods, statistical catch-at-age models admb and a
general focus on uncertainty Walters:Maguire:1996:reviews. As with any
analysis, clearer inference on the strength of a signal is available
when all uncertainty in the data is carried forth. This represents a
difficulty for synthetic analyses of fisheries data in that in an
ideal world one would access the raw data for each stock and carry
forth the uncertainty at all levels of the analysis. In the case of
assessments, the raw data is typically catch-at-age matrices and
potentially survey indices. To understand the fleet characteristics
and survey stratification schema for each stock in a potentially
global meta-analysis would be extremely time consuming and
error-prone. Instead, the expert opinion of those researchers most
familiar with the data, stock assessment authors, is used, while
recognizing that without accompanying uncertainty estimates the
strength of conclusions drawn may be weakened.  

<P>
While the database provides detailed trends for individual stocks, it
will never have the geographic and taxonomic coverage provided by
catch statistics. Assessment results will also never replace the
essential role played by fisheries-independent scientific surveys in
determining abundance, biomass and diversity trends in marine living
resources. 

<P>
BRPs derived from surplus production models are to be interpreted with
great care. For stocks where both were available we found that
Schaefer-derived <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$B_{msy}$"></SPAN> were systematically higher than those
obtained from assessments. This stems from the fact that under the
Schaefer surplus production model, MSY occurs at 50% of the carrying
capacity whereas in most age-based assessment models, yield is
maximised at a lower fraction of the carrying capacity.

<P>
The original database developed by Ransom A. Myers was used to address
a variety of ecological questions derived from stock-recruit
relationships. This was possible because the VPA-type assessment
models that comprised most of that database generated time series of
stock and recruitment with relatively few a priori assumptions.
Forward projection methods generally specify the form of the
stock-recruit relationship, and in many cases even fix parameters
(infinitely dense point prior) such as steepness.  Stock-recruitment
``data'' from such models, are clearly inappropriate for
straightforward meta-analysis. In general, as more assessments
incorporate some type of prior information from other stocks or
species Hilborn:Liermann:1998:reviews, there is less
stock-specific information available for future meta-analysis
Minte-Vera:etal:2005:cjfas.  One solution is for stock
assessments to report not only best estimates of parameters based on
all available data, but also stock-specific parameter estimates that
do not incorporate prior information from other stocks or species.
