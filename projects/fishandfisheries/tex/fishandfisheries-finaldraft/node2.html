Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Marine wild capture fisheries provide more than 80 million tons of
fisheries products (both food and industrial) per year and employ 43.5
million people (wild capture and aquaculture, FAO:sofia).
At the same time, fishing has been recognized as having one of the
most widespread human impacts in the world's oceans
Halpern:etal:2008:science, and the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that two-thirds of
fish stocks globally are fully exploited or overexploited
FAO:sofia.  While many fisheries have reduced exploitation
rates to levels that should in theory promote recovery, overfishing continues to
be a serious global problem Worm:etal:2009:science.  Fishery
managers are asked to address multiple competing objectives, including
maximizing yields, ensuring profitability, reducing bycatch, and
minimizing the risk of overfishing.  Given the large social and
economic costs Rice:etal:2003:icescm and ecosystem
consequences Frank:etal:2005:science, Myers:etal:2007:science
of collapsed fisheries, it is imperative that we are able to quickly
learn from successful and failed fisheries from around the world.

<P>
Effective management of exploited fish populations generally requires
an understanding of where the current size and harvest rate
lie in relation to the size and rate which maximize
fishery benefits or limit the risk of overfishing.  This process of
quantitative determination of stock status and estimation of reference
points is called stock assessment.  Some fisheries in developing
countries have apparently provided sustainable yields for long periods
of time without formal stock assessment (e.g. many community-managed
fisheries in Oceania; [<A
 HREF="node30.html#Johannes:2002:arees">282002Johannes</A>]).  This has been achieved by
limiting harvest rates, often through gear restrictions or seasonal and
area closures.  In modern industrialized fisheries, however, where fishing
capacity exceeds the productivity of fished stocks, stock
assessment is an integral component of responsible
management Hilborn:Walters:1992.

<P>
The global databases of fishery landings compiled by
[<A
 HREF="node30.html#FAO:fishstat">112009aFAO</A>] and extended by the Sea Around Us project
Watson:etal:2004:fandf have proven to be valuable resources
for understanding the status of fisheries worldwide; however, catch
data alone can be misleading when used as a proxy for stock size.
Many papers have used these data to examine changes in fishery status
Worm:etal:2006:science, Costello:etal:2008:science, including
changes in trophic level Pauly:etal:1998,
  Essington:etal:2006:procnatacadsci, Newton:etal:2007:currentbiol.
Most of these analyses rely (either explicitly or implicitly) on the
assumption that catch or landings is a reliable index of stock size.
Critics have pointed out that catch can change for a number of reasons
unrelated to stock size, including changes in targeting, fishing
restrictions, or market preferences deMutsert:etal:2008:pnas,
  Murawski:Methot:Tromble:2007:science, Hilborn:2007:science,
  Caddy:etal:1998:science.  Standardizing catch by the amount of
fishing effort (catch-per-unit-of-effort, CPUE) is an improvement,
particularly when these data are modeled to account for spatial,
temporal, and operational factors affecting the CPUE
Maunder:punt:2004:fishres, but CPUE can still be an unreliable
index of relative abundance since it is difficult to account for all
relevant factors Hutchings:Myers:1994:cjfas,
  Harley:etal:2001:cjfas, Walters:2003:cjfas, Polacheck:2006:marpol.

<P>
Stock assessments consider time series of catch along with other
sources of information such as: natural mortality rates, changes in
size or age composition, stock-recruitment relationships, and CPUE
coming from different fisheries and/or from fishery-independent surveys.
Because they integrate across multiple sources of information, stock
assessment models should provide a more accurate picture of
changes in abundance than catch data alone
Sibert:etal:2006:science, the trade-off being that their complexity
renders them difficult for non-experts to evaluate. Without a current and
comprehensive database of stock assessments, however scientists wishing to
conduct comparative analyses of marine fish population dynamics and
fishery status have little choice but to use problematic catch data.

<P>
The first global database of stock assessment information, the Myers
Stock Recruitment Database, was developed by the late Ransom A. Myers
and colleagues in the mid-1990s Myers:etal:1995:summary.
While the database was primarily known for its time series of stock
and recruitment, it did contain time series of fishing mortality rates
for many stocks; biological reference points were however largely
absent. The original release version of the Myers database
Myers:etal:1995:summary included spawning stock size and
recruitment time series for 274 stocks representing 92 species as well
as fishing mortality rates time series for 144 stocks. The number of
entered stocks grew to approximately 642 stocks (509 with at least one
SR pair) by 2005. Note that anadromous fishes
of the family Salmonidae comprised 290 assessments in the original
database.  The assessment results collated by Dr. Myers were used to:

...lborn:1997:csiro,
Hutchings:2001:cjfas, Hutchings:2001:jfishb} \end{inparaenum}">
<BR>.

<P>
Although the original Myers database Myers:etal:1995:summary
was critical for motivating comparative analyses in fisheries science,
most of the stocks are now 15 years out of date.  For stocks that were
depleted in 1995, the past 15 years include valuable observations at
low stock size or of a recovering population, both of which are
critical for estimating population dynamics parameters such as the
behaviour of the stock-recruitment relationship near the origin. In
addition, there have been numerous improvements in stock assessment
methodologies (including important advances in statistical
catch-at-age and catch-at-length models) and assessments have been
conducted for the first time for many species.

<P>
Meta-analyses of fishery status also have been hampered by the
lack of a global assessment database containing biological reference
points (BRPs, e.g., the total/spawning biomass and fishing mortality rate that
produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$B_{MSY}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$F_{MSY}$"></SPAN>).  Knowledge of BRPs
is important if stocks are to be managed for high yields that can be
sustained over time Mace:1994:cjfas.  Without information on
reference points, previous analyses of stock assessments or catch data
have instead relied upon non-biological thresholds to define fishery
status, such as the greatest 15-year decline
Hutchings:Reynolds:2004:biosci or 10 percent of maximum catch
Worm:etal:2006:science. Ad hoc reference points based on some
fraction of the maximum of a time series also have undesirable
statistical properties and can result in false collapses when applied
to inherently variable time series of catch or abundance
Wilberg:Miller:2007:science, branch:2008:marpol.  Complicating
comparisons of fishery status is the fact that different BRPs are used
in different parts of the world and even the same BRP can be used in a
different manner, for example, as a target or as a limit. 

<P>
Here we present a new global database of stock assessments for
commercially exploited marine fish populations.  The database is an
update and extension of that developed by Ransom A. Myers, and is named
the RAM Legacy database in honour of his pioneering contribution.  This
effort is the first global stock assessment database to:

<OL>
<LI>Use a formal relational database structure;
</LI>
<LI>Use source control software to organise release versions;
</LI>
<LI>Include metadata related to the geographic location of the stock, the type of assessment model used, and the original source document for the assessment data;
</LI>
<LI>Include biological reference points, in addition to stock-specific life history information. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We use the new RAM Legacy database (Version 1.0, 2010) to evaluate the
knowledge-base for commercially exploited marine populations in terms
of institutional contributions, geography, taxonomy, ecology,
timespan, stock assessment methodologies and BRPs. We compare the
database's taxonomic coverage to that of global fisheries catches and to
global fish diversity. We then evaluate the status of assessed stocks
globally, and by management body, referencing all stocks to a
comparable benchmark. Finally, we discuss biases in the knowledge base
for assessed marine species, highlight potential applications of the
database, point out its caveats and limitations, and outline
directions for future development.
