Geographic bias</A>
</H3>
Bias in the geographic scope of the RAM Legacy database (relative to
that of all fisheries globally) may arise for several reasons, all of
which vary geographically in their prevalence: 1. an assessment is not
conducted on a stock; 2. it is not possible to access the assessment;
or 3. the non-exhaustive collation we undertook overlooked the
assessment. Whether an assessment is conducted for a given stock
depends upon a multitude of factors, including the economic value of
the stock, the availability of fiscal resources to collect the data
required for an assessment (which frequently includes conducting
fisheries-independent research surveys) and the expertise to conduct
assessments. In general, conducting stock assessments is a costly
endeavour that is restricted to wealthy fishing nations. The legal
context where fisheries are prosecuted can also strongly influence the
requirement for conducting stock assessments. In the United States,
the Magnuson-Stevens Act defines which stocks are to be monitored and
managed, hence a large number of the assessments in the RAM Legacy
database are under the jurisdiction of the US National Marine
Fisheries Services. How accessible assessments are for entry depends
upon the transparency and access policies of the relevant management
agencies, which also varies geographically. Our search for
assessments could also give rise to geographic biases, as concerted
collation efforts have only been conducted in those known
assessment-rich regions.  It is hoped that readers of this article can
assist in correcting these biases by participating in future updates
of the RAM Legacy database, and that the development of this database
will encourage greater transparency amongst fishing nations.
