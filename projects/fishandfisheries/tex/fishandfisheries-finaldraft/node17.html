Assessments were available for 8 of the 10 largest fisheries for
individual fish stocks globally (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#tab:worldfisheries">2</A>). Assessments for Peruvian
anchoveta, the world's largest fishery, and for Japanese anchovy in
the East China Sea (the eighth largest species for an individual
stock, and tenth overall) were not accessible. Looking more broadly,
the database contains assessments for 16 of the 30 largest fisheries
for individual fish stocks globally, and 17 of the 40 largest
fisheries globally (including those recorded at lower taxonomic
resolutions) (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#tab:worldfisheries">2</A>). Many of the fisheries not included in the RAM
Legacy database, especially those recorded in the SAUP database as
``Marine fishes not identified'' (n=7), occur in developing countries
and have no known formal stock assessment conducted for them.  From a
national perspective, assessments are only included for 2 of the top
10 wild-caught marine fisheries producing nations, U.S.A. and Russia
FAO:sofia, with only two assessments from the latter. We were unable
to obtain any assessments from the other top 10 countries: China,
Peru, Indonesia, Japan, Chile, India, Thailand, Philippines FAO:sofia.
