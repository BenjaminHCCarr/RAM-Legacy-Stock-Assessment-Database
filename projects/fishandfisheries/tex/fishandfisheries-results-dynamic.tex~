\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Scope of the RAM Legacy database}
In total, REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSMENT recent stock assessments for
REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSFISH marine fish and REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSINVERT
invertebrate populations are included in the RAM Legacy database
(Version 1.0, 2010).

\subsubsection*{Management bodies and geography}
The database includes stocks assessed by fisheries management bodies
in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Russia,
South Africa and Argentina (Table~\ref{tab:mgmt}). Also included are assessments
conducted by eight Regional Fisheries Management Organizations
(RFMOs), in the Northwest Atlantic, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean
(Table~\ref{tab:mgmt}). Assessments from the United States comprise by far the most
stocks of any country or region (n=REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSNMFS);
assessments from the European Union's management body ICES comprise
the the second greatest number of stocks (n=REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSICES).
Whereas nations are responsible for managing all populations within
their EEZs, RFMOs typically focus on a certain type of species (e.g.
halibut, tunas) or fisheries (e.g. pelagic high seas) within a given
area and hence assess a smaller number of stocks.

Most assessments come from North America, Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and the High Seas, while few are entered from regions such as
Southeast Asia, South America, and the Indian Ocean (outside
Australian waters) (Figure~\ref{fig:lmes}). Assessments were available for REF:SQL:TOTNUMLMESPRIMARY LMEs, with the greatest number of
assessed stocks coming from REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:1,
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:2, REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:3,
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:4, REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:5, REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:6
and REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLME:7 (Figure~\ref{fig:lmes}).

%Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=88), the California Current (n=35, the East Bering Sea (n=32), the New Zealand Shelf (n=29), the Gulf of Alaska (n=28), the Celtic-Biscay Shelf (n=24) and the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf (n=21)

\subsubsection*{Taxonomy}

REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSBYSPECIES species from
REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSBYFAMILY families and REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSBYORDERS
orders are included in the database (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:srdb}). Five
taxonomic orders (REF:SQL:NUMASSESSORDERS:1,
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSORDERS:2, REF:SQL:NUMASSESSORDERS:3,
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSORDERS:4 and REF:SQL:NUMASSESSORDERS:5) account for
80\% of available stock assessments.  Of these, Perciformes, the
most speciose Order of marine fishes are in fact underrepresented in
the database (46.04\% of all marine fish species vs.  19\%
of all marine fish assessments), while it is the other four orders
that are taxonomically overrepresented: Clupeiformes (2.1\% of marine
fishes vs.  11\% in the database), Gadiformes (3.3\% of marine fishes
vs.  21\% in the database), Pleuronectiformes (4.5\% of marine fishes
vs.  17\% in the database), Scorpaeniformes (8.5\% of marine fishes
vs. 12\% in the database) (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}).

Assessed marine fish stocks in the RAM Legacy database comprise a
relatively small proportion of harvested taxa (REF:SQL:SRDBPERCENTSPPSAUP\% of fish species
from the SAUP database) and an even smaller proportion of marine fish
biodiversity (REF:SQL:SRDBPERCENTSPPFISHBASE\% of fish species in FishBase;
Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}). In turn, catches from the SAUP
database, which come from REF:SQL:SAUPNUMSPP species and
REF:SQL:SAUPNUMORDERS orders (Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}),
represent only REF:SQL:SAUPPERCENTSPPFISHBASE\% of the REF:SQL:NUMSPPFISHBASE species and REF:SQL:SAUPPERCENTORDERSFISHBASE\% of
the REF:SQL:NUMORDERSFISHBASE different orders present in FishBase
(Figure~\ref{fig:taxo:threepanel}).

%species are more poorly taxonomically represented in the database than
%fishes (Figure 4XX). Only XX\% .....

Table~\ref{tab:worldfisheries}

\subsubsection*{Timespan }

Of the REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSMENT stock assessments, time series data of
catch/landings were available for REF:SQL:NUMCATCHSERIES stocks (REF:SQL:PERCENTCATCHSERIES\%),
of SSB for REF:SQL:NUMSSBSERIES stocks (REF:SQL:PERCENTSSBSERIES\%), and of recruitment for
REF:SQL:NUMRSERIES stocks (REF:SQL:PERCENTRSERIES\%).  The median lengths of
catch/landings, SSB, and recruitment timeseries were
REF:SQL:MEDCATCHLEN, REF:SQL:MEDSSBLEN, and REF:SQL:MEDRLEN years,
respectively.  The time period covered by 90\%
of assessments is: catch/landings (REF:SQL:CATCHTIMESPAN90), SSB (REF:SQL:SSBTIMESPAN90), recruitment
(REF:SQL:RTIMESPAN90), while that covered by 50\% of assessments is: catch/landings
(REF:SQL:CATCHTIMESPAN50), SSB (REF:SQL:SSBTIMESPAN50), recruitment (REF:SQL:RTIMESPAN50) (Figure~\ref{fig:orca}).

\subsubsection*{Stock assessment methodologies and BRPs}
In addition to the REF:SQL:TOTNUMASSESSMENT assessments in the
database, indices of relative abundance from scientific surveys are
available for an additional REF:SQL:TOTNUMWITHOUTMODEL stocks. The
three most common assessment methods were REF:SQL:NUMASSESSMETHOD:1,
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSMETHOD:2 and REF:SQL:NUMASSESSMETHOD:3..  .....Need
to add a sentence here about the regional differences.... .


The total number and percentage of assessments that reported biomass-
or exploitation- based reference points of any sort was
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSBIOREF (REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSBIOREF\%) and
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSEXPLOITREF (REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSEXPLOITREF\%),
respectively. From these assessments,
REF:SQL:NUMASSESSBIOANDEXPLOITREF report both a biomass-based and an
exploitation-based BRP and appear as solid dots on
Figures~\ref{fig:friedegg} and ~\ref{fig:friedeggmgmt}. Schaefer-derived BRPs
add an additional REF:SQL:NUMADDITIONALASSESSSCHAEFER assessments, for
a total of REF:SQL:NUMASSESSFRIEDEGG assessments used to generate
Figure~\ref{fig:friedegg}. Overall,
REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSMENTSBELOWBMSY\% of assessed stocks are below
their biomass-related MSY BRP and
REF:SQL:PERCENTASSESSMENTSABOVEFMSY\% are above their
exploitation-related MSY BRP. Different management bodies have
different overall status of current biomass to BRPs
(Figure~\ref{fig:friedeggmgmt}).

\subsubsection*{Ecology}
Assessed species span a range of ecological traits. In terms of their
trophic level, we see XXX (Figure~\ref{fig:TL}). The total number and
percentage of assessments that reported any life-history information
(growth, maturity, fecundity) was REF:SQL:NUMASSESSLIFE.

%trophic level: can we make a barplot showing number of stocks by
%trophic level for a) overexploited, and b) not overexploited species
