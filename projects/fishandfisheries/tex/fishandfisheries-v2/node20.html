Geographic bias</A>
</H3>

<P>
Large Marine Ecosystems were defined by NOAA (<A
 HREF="node27.html#NOAA:LME64:1998">NOAA, 1998</A>).
They encompass the continental shelves of the world's oceans and
represent the most productive areas of the oceans.  However, they do
not include a classification category for large migratory species such
as tuna that also inhabit the open ocean and is not associated with
given LMEs. Each species of highly migratory species is also observed
in a number of LMEs. While the global coverage of LMEs is beneficial
to classify assessments from around the world, it is debatable whether
once can use each LME as an independent unit of comparison. 

<P>
There are important geographic biases in the amount of assessments
entered per LME (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#fig:lmes">B.2</A>). A large proportion of
assessments come from North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand
and the High Seas. Few assessments are entered from regions such as
Southeast Asia, South America, and the Indian Ocean (outside
Australian waters). The question of geographic bias relates to
whether: <BR>
<IMG

 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="\begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape )]\item an assessment is
conducted on a stock; \it...
...tive collation we undertook may have
overlooked the assessment \end{inparaenum}">
<BR>. Whether an assessment is
conducted for a given stock depends upon a multitude of factors,
including the economic value of the stock and availability of fiscal
resources to collect the data required for an assessment. How
accessible assessments are for entry depends upon the transparency and
access policies of the relevant management agencies, which varies
geographically. Similarly, the legal context where fisheries are
prosecuted will strongly influence the requirement for conducting
stock assessments. In the United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Act
defines what stocks are to be monitored and managed, hence a large
number of the assessments in the RAM Legacy database are under the
jurisdiction of the US National Marine Fisheries Services.

<P>
Our incomplete search for assessments could also give rise to
geographic biases, as concerted collation efforts have only been
conducted in those assessment-rich regions of Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#fig:lmes">B.2</A>.
It is hoped that readers of this article can assist in correcting
these biases by participating in future updates of the RAM Legacy
database.
