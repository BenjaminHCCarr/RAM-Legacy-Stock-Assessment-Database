Caveats and limitations</A>
</H2>
Assessment outputs e.g. biomass timeseries, are estimates, not raw
data. The uncertainty associated with these estimates should be
carried forth in subsequent analyses. The RAM Legacy database
structure allows for estimates of uncertainty (standard errors, 95%
credible/confidence intervals), however these estimates are only
occassionally provided because they aren't produced by the assessment
model (e.g. non-bootstrapped VPA assessments) or the focus of the
assessment document was on central tendency (e.g. mean biomass), not
the associated uncertainty. Note that this view is changing with the
advent of MCMC aproaches to Bayesian inference for assessments,
bootstrap methods, statistical catch-at-age models and a focus on
uncertainty (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Walters:Maguire:1996:reviews">Walters &amp; Maguire, 1996</A>). As with any
analysis, clearer inference on the strength of a signal is available
when all uncertainty in the data is carried forth. This represents a
difficulty for large-scale analyses of fisheries data in that in an
ideal world one would access the raw data per sub-unit (e.g. stock)
and carry forth the uncertainty at all levels of the analysis. In the
case of assessments, the raw data is typically catch-at-age matrices
and potentially survey indices. To understand the fleet
characteristics and survey stratification schema for each stock in a
potentially global meta-analysis would be extremely time consuming and
error-prone. So, the expert opinion of those researchers most familiar
with the data, stock assessment authors, is used but without
accompanying uncertainty estimates the strength of conclusions drawn
may be weakened.

<P>
The original database developed by Dr. Myers was used to address a
variety of ecological question derived from stock-recruit
relationships. This was possible because of the timeseries of stock
and recruitment generated in assessment using VPA-type models. With
the increasing use of statistical catch-at-age/length models, an
underlying stock-recruit relationship is assumed to exist. Estimating
the parameters of a stock-recruit relationship using timeseries from
such models does not constitute a valid statistical procedure. 

<P>
Point data are stored in the database with an associated unit, value
and year. We expect to also include age-varying and length-varying
data such as maturity ogive and age-disaggregated natural mortality in
subsequent releases of the RAM Legacy database. In addition to the
initial aim of providing reliable access to timeseries information
about stocks, we hope to also stimulate research in the relationships
of life-history characteristics and their relation to exploitation.
