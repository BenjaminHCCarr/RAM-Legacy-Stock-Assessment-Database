Data entry</A>
</H2>
Data were entered, by an assessment recorder (preferably an assessment
author), into a spreadsheet template file, which has three worksheets:
(1) meta, (2) biometrics, (3) timeseries. The template was flexible in
that stock-specific information could be added depending on the scope
of the information contained within the assessment.  The `meta'
worksheet contained information about the stock (e.g. taxonomic
information), the recorder entering the data, and references for the
stock assessment document. The `biometrics' worksheet was where point
estimates (not time series) were entered.  This included life history
information, biological reference points, as well as details about the
time series data such as the age and sex of spawners, the ages used to
compute the fishing mortality etc.  The `timeseries' worksheet
contained the entered time series data for the stock. Depending on the
type of assessment conducted, model results were available for year,
SSB (spawner stock biomass), TB (total biomass), R (recruits), TC
(total catch), F (fishing mortality).
