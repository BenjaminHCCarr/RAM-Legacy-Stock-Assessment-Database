Data integrity and quality control flow</A>

The goal of the database quality control was to help ensure that the data entered
mirror those present in the assessment document. The process consisted
of entering the submitted assessment spreadsheet into a development
database from which an automatic summary document was generated. This document contained: summary details of the stock,
a selection of biometrics and ratios for comparison (e.g. current
biomass relative to the reference point), and time series plots of the
biomass, recruitment, and exploitation trajectories. This ``Quality
Assurance/Quality Controlled (QA/QC)'' document was then returned to
the assessment recorder and subsequent correspondence was captured in a
Plone bug tracking system so that an electronic trail was established.
Once the assessment recorder checked the QA/QC document and, if
necessary, amended the assessment spreadsheet, the final spreadsheet
was entered into the operational database and a quality controlled
flag is inserted to signify that the data have passed this check.
