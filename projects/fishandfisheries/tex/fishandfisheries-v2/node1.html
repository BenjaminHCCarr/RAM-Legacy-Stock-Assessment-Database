<P>
Data used to assess the status of individual fish stocks varies from
very little information on many of the world's artisanal fisheries, to
commercial landings at various levels of geographic and taxonomic
aggregation, research surveys, and sophisticated population dynamics
models that integrate many sources of information.  Previous
evaluations of the state of global fisheries have used catch or
landings data, which may be poor proxies for fish stock abundances. A
global compilation of stock assessment data in the mid-1990s enabled
substantial syntheses of stock status; however the focus of this
database was on stock-recruitment relationships and it is now 15 years
out of date. To facilitate contemporary syntheses, we have assembled a
comprehensive database of the most intensively studied commercially
exploited marine fish stocks. The database includes time series of:
total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality, and
catch; reference points; and ancillary information on the life
history, management, and assessment methods for each stock.  Here, we
present the first overview of the structure and content of the
database. We further evaluate the knowledge-base for assessed marine
fishes. Globally, publicly available stock assessments were found for
347 stocks (305 species of
fishes representing 46 families and
42 species of invertebrates representing
13 families), from 18
national and international management institutions. Assessments are
available for only XX percent of global marine fisheries catches by
weight and XX percent by value.  There is substantial spatial
variation in availability of assessed stocks, with XX percent coming
from north temperate regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific).
Geographic differences in assessment methods show that Statistical
Catch at Age (SCA) models are widely used by the west coast of the
U.S. (XX percent of assessments), regional fishery management
organizations in the Pacific (XX percent of assessments), and New
Zealand (XX percent of assessments); the east coast of the U.S. is
transitioning from Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) to SCA (XX
percent of assessments conducted since 2000 have used SCA); while VPA
is still the dominant assessment
technique in western Europe (XX percent of assessments).
