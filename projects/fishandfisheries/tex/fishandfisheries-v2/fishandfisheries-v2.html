Abstract</A>
</H1>

<P>
Data used to assess the status of individual fish stocks varies from
very little information on many of the world's artisanal fisheries, to
commercial landings at various levels of geographic and taxonomic
aggregation, research surveys, and sophisticated population dynamics
models that integrate many sources of information.  Previous
evaluations of the state of global fisheries have used catch or
landings data, which may be poor proxies for fish stock abundances. A
global compilation of stock assessment data in the mid-1990s enabled
substantial syntheses of stock status; however the focus of this
database was on stock-recruitment relationships and it is now 15 years
out of date. To facilitate contemporary syntheses, we have assembled a
comprehensive database of the most intensively studied commercially
exploited marine fish stocks. The database includes time series of:
total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality, and
catch; reference points; and ancillary information on the life
history, management, and assessment methods for each stock.  Here, we
present the first overview of the structure and content of the
database. We further evaluate the knowledge-base for assessed marine
fishes. Globally, publicly available stock assessments were found for
322 stocks (286 species of
fishes representing 45 families and
36 species of invertebrates representing
12 families), from 18
national and international management institutions. Assessments are
available for only XX percent of global marine fisheries catches by
weight and XX percent by value.  There is substantial spatial
variation in availability of assessed stocks, with XX percent coming
from north temperate regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific).
Geographic differences in assessment methods show that Statistical
Catch at Age (SCA) models are widely used by the west coast of the
U.S. (XX percent of assessments), regional fishery management
organizations in the Pacific (XX percent of assessments), and New
Zealand (XX percent of assessments); the east coast of the U.S. is
transitioning from Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) to SCA (XX
percent of assessments conducted since 2000 have used SCA); while VPA
is still the dominant assessment
technique in western Europe (XX percent of assessments).

Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Marine wild capture fisheries provide more than 80 million tons of
fisheries products (both food and industrial) per year and employ 43.5
million people (wild capture and aquaculture, (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#FAO:fishstat">FAO, 2009</A>)).
At the same time, fishing has been recognized as having one of the
most widespread human impacts in the world's oceans
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Halpern:etal:2008:science">Halpern <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2008</A>), and the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that two-thirds of
fish stocks globally are fully exploited or overexploited
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#FAO:fishstat">FAO, 2009</A>).  While many fisheries have reduced exploitation
rates to levels that should promote recovery, overfishing continues to
be a serious global problem (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Worm:etal:2009:science">Worm <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2009</A>).  Fishery
managers are asked to address multiple competing objectives, including
maximizing yields, ensuring profitability, reducing bycatch, and
minimizing the risk of overfishing.  Given the enormous social and
economic costs (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Rice:etal:2003:icescm">Rice <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2003</A>) and ecosystems
consequences (<A NAME="tex2html46" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Myers:etal:2007:science">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2007</A>; <A NAME="tex2html47" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Frank:etal:2005:science">Frank <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2005</A>)
of collapsed fisheries, it is imperative that we are able to quickly
learn from successful and failed fisheries from around the world.

<P>
Effective management of exploited fish populations generally requires
an understanding of where the current size and harvest rate
lie in relation to the size and rate which maximize
fishery benefits or limit the risk of overfishing.  This process of
quantitative determination of stock status and estimation of reference
points is called stock assessment.  Some fisheries in developing
countries have apparently provided sustainable yields for long periods
of time without formal stock assessment (e.g. many community-managed
fisheries in Oceania, (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Johannes:2002:arees">Johannes, 2002</A>)).  This has been achieved by
limiting harvest rates, often through gear restrictions or seasonal or
area closures.  In modern industrialized fisheries, however, where fishing
capacity exceeds the productivity of fished stocks stock
assessment is an integral component of responsible
management (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Hilborn:Walters:1992">Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992</A>).

<P>
Even in developed countries, however, not all stocks are assessed.
For example, in 2007, of the 528 fish and invertebrate stocks
recognized by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), only 179,
or slightly over one-third, were fully assessed
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#NMFS:2008:status">National Marine Fisheries Service, 2008</A>).  An assessment by the European Environment
Agency (EEA) in 2006 indicated that the percentage of commercial
landings obtained from assessed stocks ranged between 66-97 percent in
northern European waters and 30-77 percent in the Mediterranean
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#eea:2009:status">European Environment Agency, 2009</A>).  The New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries
reports the status of 117 stocks or sub-stocks out of a total of 628
stocks managed under New Zealand's Quota Management System
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#NZMF:2009">New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries, 2009</A>).  In Australia, 98 federally managed stocks have
been assessed (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Wilson:etal:2009:status">Wilson <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2009</A>) out of an unknown total.
The extent to which stocks are assessed elsewhere in the world is
currently unknown.

<P>
The global database of fishery landings compiled by FAO (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#FAO:fishstat">FAO, 2009</A>)
and synthesized by the Sea Around Us project
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Watson:etal:2004:fandf">Watson <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2004</A>) has proven to be a valuable resource
for understanding fishery status; however, catch data alone can be
misleading when used as a proxy for stock size.  Many papers have used
these catch databases to examine changes in fishery status
(<A NAME="tex2html48" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Worm:etal:2006:science">Worm <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>; <A NAME="tex2html49" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Costello:etal:2008:science">Costello <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2008</A>), including
changes in trophic level (<A NAME="tex2html50" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Essington:etal:2006:procnatacadsci">Essington <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>; <A NAME="tex2html51" target="contents"

  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Newton:etal:2007:currentbiol">Newton <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2007</A>).
Most of these analyses rely (either explicitly or implicitly) on the
assumption that catch or landings is a reliable index of stock size.
Critics have pointed out that catch can change for a number of reasons
unrelated to stock size, including changes in targeting, fishing
restrictions, or market preferences (<A NAME="tex2html53" target="contents"

  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#deMutsert:etal:2008:pnas">de&nbsp;Mutsert <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2008</A>).  Even
when catch is standardized by the amount of fishing effort
(catch-per-unit-of-effort, CPUE), it can be an unreliable index of
relative abundance (<A NAME="tex2html56" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Walters:2003:cjfas">Walters, 2003</A>; <A NAME="tex2html57" target="contents"

  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Hutchings:Myers:1994:cjfas">Hutchings &amp; Myers, 1994</A>).
Stock assessments consider time series of catch along with other
sources of information such as: natural mortality rates, changes in
size or age composition, stock-recruitment relationships, and CPUE of
different sectors or of fishery-independent surveys.  Because they
integrate across multiple sources of information, stock assessment
models are thought to provide a more accurate picture of changes in
abundance than catch data alone (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Sibert:etal:2006:science">Sibert <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>). Yet,
without a current and comprehensive database of stock assessments,
scientists wishing to conduct comparative analyses of marine fish
population dynamics and fishery status have little choice but to use
problematic catch data.

<P>
The first global database of stock assessment information, the Myers
Stock Recruitment Database, was developed by Ransom Myers and
colleagues in the mid-1990s (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Myers:etal:1995:summary">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1995b</A>).  While
the database was primarily known for its time series of stock and
recruitment, it did contain time series of fishing mortality rates for
many stocks, however, biological reference points were largely absent. The
original release version of the Myers database
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Myers:etal:1995:summary">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1995b</A>) contained spawning stock size and
recruitment time series for 274 stocks representing 92 species as well
as time series of fishing mortality rates for 144 stocks. It was used
to: <BR>

<BR>.  The Myers
database has also been used for several studies of collapse and
recovery of exploited fish populations (<A NAME="tex2html60" target="contents"

  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Hutchings:2001:jfishb">2001</A>)..

<P>
Although the original Myers database (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Myers:etal:1995:summary">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1995b</A>)
has proven to be a valuable resource, it is now 15 years out of date.
For stocks that were depleted in 1995, these additional 15 years
include valuable observations at low stock size or of a recovering
population, both of which are critical for estimating population
dynamics parameters such as the behaviour of the stock-recruitment
relationship near the origin. In addition, there have been numerous improvements in
stock assessment methodologies (including important advances in
statistical catch-at-age or catch-at-length models) and assessments
have been conducted for the first time for many species.

<P>
Previous meta-analyses of fishery status have been hampered by the
lack of a global assessment database containing biological reference
points (BRPs, e.g., the total/spawning biomass and fishing mortality rate that
produce Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B_{MSY}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$F_{MSY}$"></SPAN>).  Knowledge of BRPs
is important if stocks are to be managed for high yields that can be
sustained over time (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Mace:1994:cjfas">Mace, 1994</A>).  Without information on
reference points, previous analyses of stock assessments or catch data
have been forced to use non-biological thresholds to define fishery
status, such as the greatest 15-year decline
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Hutchings:Reynolds:2004:biosci">Hutchings &amp;
  Reynolds, 2004</A>) or 10 percent of maximum catch
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Worm:etal:2006:science">Worm <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>). Ad hoc reference points based on some
fraction of the maximum of a time series also have undesirable
statistical properties and can result in false collapses when applied
to inherently variable time series of catch or abundance
(<A NAME="tex2html63" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#branch:2008:marpol">Branch, 2008</A>; <A NAME="tex2html64" target="contents"
  HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Wilberg:Miller:2007:science">Wilberg &amp; Miller, 2007</A>).  Complicating
comparisons of fishery status is the fact that different BRPs are used
in different parts of the world and even the same BRP can be used in a
different manner, for example, as a target or a limit. 

<P>
Here we present a new global database of stock assessments for
commercially exploited marine fish populations.  The database is an
update and extension of that developed by Ransom Myers, and is named
the RAM Legacy database in honor of his pioneering contribution.  This
effort is the first global stock assessment database to:

<OL>
<LI>Use a formal relational database structure;
</LI>
<LI>Use source control software to organise release versions;
</LI>
<LI>Include metadata related to the geographic location of the stock, the type of assessment model used, and the original source document for the assessment data;
</LI>
<LI>Include biological reference points and stock-specific life history information. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We have used the database to assess the knowledge-base for management of marine fish populations and address the following questions:

<OL>
<LI>What fraction of world wild-capture fishery landings come from assessed stocks and how does this proportion vary by region?
</LI>
<LI>What is the temporal coverage of stock assessments, i.e. how far back do stock assessments look when reconstructing trends in abundance?
</LI>
<LI>What are the taxonomic and geographic biases, if any, in assessed stocks?
</LI>
<LI>Which stock assessment approaches and biological reference points are used and how does this vary by region?
</LI>

The RAM Legacy database</A>
</H2>
The RAM Legacy database is a global relational database designed and
developed to store data from all current and accessible population
dynamics model-based fisheries stock assessments for marine fish and
invertebrate populations. Time series of spawning stock biomass (SSB),
total biomass (TB), recruits (R), total catch (TC) or landings (TL),
and fishing mortality (F) from individual stock assessments form the
core of the database.  Apart from catch/landings, these time series
are not raw data, but rather the output of population dynamics models;
depending on the type of assessment model not all of these time series
were available for every stock. The database also contains details
about the time series data, including the age and sex of spawners, age
of recruits, and the ages used to compute the fishing mortality, as
well as BRPs and some life history information (e.g. growth
parameters, age and length at 50% maturity, natural mortality).
Metadata for each stock assessment consists of taxonomic information
about the species (retrieved from the Integrated Taxonomic Information
System (ITIS) (http://www.itis.gov)), the geographic location of the
stock (primary, and in some cases, secondary and tertiary Large Marine
Ecosystem, LME), the management body that conducted the assessment,
the assessment methodology, the reference for the stock assessment
document, the name of the recorder entering the assessment data, and
the date the assessment was entered.  Many assessments, particularly
those for invertebrates, were based only on CPUE time series rather
than population dynamics models. While we included these in the
database, the analyses presented here focus on stocks assessed by
proper assessments.

<P>
We employed a variety of search methods in an attempt to obtain all
recent fisheries stock assessments.  Publically available stock
assessment reports available from the internet were the primary data
source.  These reports were obtained either from the website of the
relevant management agency or directly from stock assessment
scientists.  Assessments also were obtained from the primary
literature and through personal contacts at fisheries management
agencies.  Significant contributions also were made by the other members
of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)
working group ``Finding common ground in marine conservation and
management''. Relevant assessment data were first transferred into a
standardized spreadsheet template by a number of recorders, including
ourselves, assessment authors, our NCEAS collaborators, and associated
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and then uploaded into
the relational database management system by the first author.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00032000000000000000">
Database structure and advantages</A>
</H2>
The database is implemented in the Open Source PostgreSQL relational
database management system (RDBMS) (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#postgresql:2009">PostgreSQL Global Development Group, 2009</A>), and includes tables for the assessment metadata,
time series values, time series units, and biometrics (a catch-all term
for data, such as life history characteristics or BRPs, that are not
part of a time series). The relationship between the different database
tables is shown in the entity relationship diagram (Fig. S1).

<P>
RDBMSs form the server back-end to a great many applications of
interest to ecologists, including web-clients and GIS software, and
have a number of advantages over spreadsheet or flat text file data
compilations.  First, housing stock assessments in an RDBMS allows
multiple users to concurrently access and extract subsets of data in
an efficient and reproducible manner. Second, with the development of
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow analytical
softwares to directly communicate and extract data from the database,
a common data environment is established, independent of one's choice
of analytical software (e.g., SAS:SAS ACCESS, Matlab: Matlab/Database,
R:RDBI/RODBC, Perl:DBI, etc.).  Users familiar with Structured Query
Language (SQL) can also query the database directly from their
analytical software of choice and the same SQL query will extract the
same data through each of these applications.  Third, data products
tailored to specific projects can be generated and stored as dynamic
(continually updated) ``views'' within the database.  These are
typically rectangular, spreadsheet-like results of an expansive query
of the relevant tables that can be readily read into all commonly-used
analytical software.  The use of views is, however, greatly
advantageous over manipulating spreadsheets or flat text files for
importing into a specific analytic software, which runs the risk of
losing data integrity (e.g. multiple copies) and becomes impractical
with large, non-rectangular datasets and multiple users.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">
Data integrity and quality control</A>
</H2>
We have employed several mechanisms to ensure that the database is of
high quality. During the data recording process, assessment authors
often were contacted to clarify aspects of the assessment or to obtain
more detailed data. Time series data presented in figures were, for
example, only entered into the database if the exact numbers could be
obtained from the assessment or its authors. In cases where multiple
models were presented in an assessment without a preferred or&nbsp;best&nbsp;
model being denoted, we attempted to ascertain which model was
preferred by the stock assessment scientist, but included all model
results whenever this was not possible.  Once uploaded into the
database all stock assessments underwent an additional&nbsp;Quality
Assurance/Quality Control&nbsp; (QA/QC) step, to ensure that the entered
data replicated that of the original assessment document exactly. This
process consisted of creating a QA/QC summary document for each
assessment, containing summary details of the stock, a selection of
biometrics and ratios for comparison (e.g. current status relative to
BRP), and time series plots of the biomass, recruitment, and
exploitation trajectories. QA/QC documents were then returned to
assessment recorders and an electronic trail of subsequent
correspondence was captured using a bug tracking system. Recorders
were responsible for checking, and where necessary correcting, their
QA/QC documents, after which all corrections were transmitted back to
the operational database and a quality controlled flag was inserted to
signify the assessment had passed the check. Only assessments that
have passed this QA/QC step are available for subsequent analyses.

To facilitate integration of the RAM Legacy database with related
databases, such as Fishbase (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Froese:Pauly:2009:fishbase">Froese &amp; Pauly, 2009</A>) and the
Sea Around Us Project's (SAUP) global landings database
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Watson:etal:2004:fandf">Watson <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2004</A>), each species present in the RAM Legacy
database was assigned a matching FishBase species name and species
code as well as the SAUP taxon code. Additionally, each stock was
assigned to a primary, secondary, and tertiary Large Marine Ecosystem
(LME) (<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#NOAA:LME64:1998">NOAA, 1998</A>).  LMEs encompass the continental shelves
of the world's oceans and represent the most productive areas of the
oceans.  Open ocean areas beyond the continental shelves are, however,
not included. Large, highly migratory oceanic species such as tuna
were therefore assigned to new categories ``Atlantic High Seas'',
``Pacific High Seas'', ``Indian High Seas'', and ``Subantarctic High
Seas''.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00035000000000000000">
Database analyses: Assessing the knowledge-base for commercially exploited stocks</A>
</H2>
We first assess the scope of the stock assessments held in the current
version of the RAM Legacy database (Version 1.0, 2010) in terms of
institutional contributions, geography, taxonomy, global fisheries,
timespan, and ecology. To evaluate the taxonomic scope of the
database, we compare the taxonomy of assessed stocks with the
diversity of i) all marine fishes (as represented by FishBase), and
ii) marine fishes in global fisheries catches (as represented by the
SAUP database), and discuss taxonomic biases in species included in
catch data and in populations assessed using stock assessments. To
determine what fraction of world wild-capture fisheries landings come
from assessed stocks, we used the SAUP's average global fisheries
catches from the most recent ten years of available data (1995-2004);
we also discuss limitations to obtaining assessments for some of the
world's major fisheries.

<P>
Next, we briefly overview the types of asssessment models and BRPs
contained within the stock assessments, and the frequencies of
different assessment methods and BRPs overall and by management body.
We then evaluate the status of assessed stocks overall, by management
body and by trophic level, using standard reference points so that all
stocks are referenced to a comparable benchmark.  Following

Scope of the RAM Legacy database</A>
</H2>
In total, 322 recent stock assessments for
286 marine fish and 36
invertebrate populations are included in the RAM Legacy database
(Version 1.0, 2010).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00041100000000000000">
Management bodies and geography</A>
</H3>
The database includes stocks assessed by fisheries management bodies
in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Russia,
South Africa and Argentina (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#tab:mgmt">1</A>). Also included are assessments
conducted by eight Regional Fisheries Management Organizations
(RFMOs), in the Northwest Atlantic, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean
(Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#tab:mgmt">1</A>). Assessments from the United States comprise by far the most
stocks of any country or region (n=137);
assessments from the European Union's management body ICES comprise
the the second greatest number of stocks (n=63).
Whereas nations are responsible for managing all populations within
their EEZs, RFMOs typically focus on a certain type of species (e.g.
halibut, tunas) or fisheries (e.g. pelagic high seas) within a given
area and hence assess a smaller number of stocks.

<P>
Most assessments come from North America, Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and the High Seas, while few are entered from regions such as
Southeast Asia, South America, and the Indian Ocean (outside
Australian waters) (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:lmes">1</A>). LMEs with the greatest number of
assessed stocks are the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=58),
California Current (n=35), New Zealand Shelf (n=29),
Celtic-Biscay Shelf (n=26), Gulf of Alaska (n=25), East Bering Sea (n=22)
and Southeast U.S. Continental Shelf (n=20) (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:lmes">1</A>).

Taxonomy</A>

<P>
157 species from
57 families and 20
orders are included in the database (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:srdb">2</A>). Five
taxonomic orders (Gadiformes (n=67),
Perciformes (n=60), Pleuronectiformes (n=53),
Scorpaeniformes (n=41) and Clupeiformes (n=36)) account for
80% of available stock assessments.  Of these, Perciformes, the
most speciose Order of marine fishes are in fact underrepresented in
the database (46.04% of all marine fish species vs.  19%
of all marine fish assessments), while it is the other four orders
that are taxonomically overrepresented: Clupeiformes (2.1% of marine
fishes vs.  11% in the database), Gadiformes (3.3% of marine fishes
vs.  21% in the database), Pleuronectiformes (4.5% of marine fishes
vs.  17% in the database), Scorpaeniformes (8.5% of marine fishes
vs. 12% in the database) (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>).

<P>
Assessed marine fish stocks in the RAM Legacy database comprise a
relatively small proportion of harvested taxa (XX% of fish species
from the SAUP database) and an even smaller proportion of marine fish
biodiversity (XX% of fish species in FishBase; Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>). In turn,
catches from the SAUP database, which come from XX species and XX
orders (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>), represent only XX% of the 12339 species and XX%
of the 54 different orders present in FishBase (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:taxo:threepanel">3</A>).

Discussion</A>
</H1>

<P>
The RAM Legacy Database of available stock assessments for the world's
marine fisheries, although non-exhaustive, provides a basis to
evaluate the existing knowledge-base of exploited marine populations.
The stocks comprising the database are predominantly from developed
nations with properly identified fisheries management bodies and tend
to cover a recent time period. Few assessments extend back beyond 30
years from present. The taxonomic makeup of available assessments is a
very limited subset of the accepted taxonomic coverage of marine
species worldwide.

Geographic bias</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are important geographic biases in the amount of assessments entered per LME

<P>
The question of geographic bias relates to whether: <BR>
<IMG

 SRC="img22.png"
 ALT="\begin{inparaenum}[1\upshape )]\item an assessment is
conducted on a stock; \it...
...tive collation we undertook may have
overlooked the assessment \end{inparaenum}">
<BR>. Whether an assessment is conducted for a
given stock depends upon a multitude of factors, including the
economic value of the stock and availability of fiscal resources to
collect the data required for an assessment. How accessible
assessments are for entry depends upon the transparency and access
policies of the relevant management agencies, which varies
geographically. Similarly, the legal context where fisheries are
prosecuted will strongly influence the requirement for conducting
stock assessments. In the United States, the Magnuson-Stevens Act
defines what stocks are to be monitored and managed, hence a large
number of the assessments in the RAM Legacy database are under the
jurisdiction of the US National Marine Fisheries Services.  Our
incomplete search for assessments could also give rise to geographic
biases, as concerted collation efforts have only been conducted in
those assessment-rich regions of It is hoped that readers of this
article can assist in correcting these biases by participating in
future updates of the RAM Legacy database.

<P>
Note Also: from Figure 4 SOFIA 2008 (FAO 2009) - The top 10
wild-caught marine fisheries producer countries are China, Peru,
U.S.A., Indonesia, Japan, Chile, India, Russia, Thailand, Philippines.
We only have assessments for U.S.A. and Russia (and only 2 for
Russia!). Most major fish producing countires do not do assessments or
do not make them accessible, still to be decided how to phrase this.

Caveats and limitations</A>
</H2>
Assessment outputs e.g. biomass timeseries, are model estimates, not
raw data. The uncertainty associated with these estimates should be
carried forth in subsequent analyses. The RAM Legacy database
structure allows for estimates of uncertainty (standard errors, 95%
credible/confidence intervals), however these estimates are often
missing from assessments either because they aren't produced by the
assessment model (e.g. non-bootstrapped VPA assessments) or the focus
of the assessment document was on central tendency (e.g. mean
biomass), not the associated uncertainty. Note that this view is
changing with the advent of MCMC aproaches to Bayesian inference for
assessments, bootstrap methods, statistical catch-at-age models
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#admb">ADMB Project, 2009</A>) and a general focus on uncertainty
(<A
 HREF="fishandfisheries-v2.html#Walters:Maguire:1996:reviews">Walters &amp; Maguire, 1996</A>). As with any analysis, clearer
inference on the strength of a signal is available when all
uncertainty in the data is carried forth. This represents a difficulty
for large-scale analyses of fisheries data in that in an ideal world
one would access the raw data per sub-unit (e.g. stock) and carry
forth the uncertainty at all levels of the analysis. In the case of
assessments, the raw data is typically catch-at-age matrices and
potentially survey indices. To understand the fleet characteristics
and survey stratification schema for each stock in a potentially
global meta-analysis would be extremely time consuming and
error-prone. So, the expert opinion of those researchers most familiar
with the data, stock assessment authors, is used but without
accompanying uncertainty estimates the strength of conclusions drawn
may be weakened.

<P>
The original database developed by Dr. Myers was used to address a
variety of ecological question derived from stock-recruit
relationships. This was possible because of the timeseries of stock
and recruitment generated in assessment using VPA-type models. With
the increasing use of statistical catch-at-age/length models, an
underlying stock-recruit relationship is assumed to exist. Estimating
the parameters of a stock-recruit relationship using timeseries from
such models does not constitute a valid statistical procedure.  More
generally, the increasing use of Bayesian methods that incorporate
prior information poses a challenge for meta-analysis of such model
outputs.

<P>
Point data are stored in the database with an associated unit, value
and year. We expect to also include age-varying and length-varying
data such as maturity ogive and age-disaggregated natural mortality in
subsequent releases of the RAM Legacy database. In addition to the
initial aim of providing reliable access to timeseries information
about stocks, we hope to also stimulate research in the relationships
of life-history characteristics and their relation to exploitation.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">
Future Development</A>
</H2>
It is anticipated that the RAM Legacy database will continue to grow
with hitherto unentered stocks and updated assessments for already
included stocks. The ultimate goal is to provide a data standard for
researchers to use results from multiple regions to assist in their
own applied and fundamental research in population ecology, fisheries
science, and conservation biology. The development of a standard for
assessment reporting would assist in realizing this goal. For example,
ICES assessments have a very regular standard, including agreed-upon
reference points and regular estimate reporting. This makes the
process of data collation much more routine than unstandardized
documents where the recorder trawls through a report for information.
Certainly different stocks and regions require different formats but
the basic output tables, consisting of total and spawning biomass,
recruitment, catch/landings, estimated fishing mortality over
vulnerable age groups, associated measures of uncertainty, and
commonly-used reference points would streamline the process immensely.
A process whereby the assessment spreadsheets are filled out at each
assessment meeting would be the least error prone method. In return,
the assessment scientists can access results for a global collation of
assessments to further their own research initiatives in population
assessment and management. Other products include
management-agency-level reports containing summaries of all stocks
within their remit. Future versions to the database will also include
timelines of management actions per stock. The RAM Legacy database
contains the corresponding species codes to the Sea Around Us Project
and FishBase, thus facilitating researchers's use of a global
fisheries data ``toolkit'' to address questions on the relationships
between life history attributes and resulting population dynamics in
an exploited setting.

<P>
Figure 1. Global map of the Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) showing the
number of stock assessments present in the database for each LME or High Seas area. 
<BR>
<P>
Figure 2. Taxonomic coverage of assessed marine species present in the
RAM Legacy database. The circle located near the middle of the circular
dendrogram represents kingdom Animalia and each subsequent branching
represents a different taxonomic group (Kingdom to Phylum to Class to
Order to Family to Genus to Species). The width of each line is
proportional to the square root of the number of assessments in the
database. The outermost lines represent species and the number of
lines is the number of assessments for each species. The names of
multi-assessment species are not repeated on the outermost portion of
the dendrogram but continue counter-clockwise from the first entry.
Note that branch lengths are chosen for graphical purposes and do not
convey phylogenetic distance.
<BR>
<P>
Figure 3. Comparison of the taxonomic diversity of marine
species as provided by FishBase (top panel), the coverage of catch
data as provided by the Sea Around Us Project (SAUP) database (middle
panel) and the RAM Legacy database (bottom panel). To facilitate the
identification of the taxonomic groups that are not presented in the catch
and assessment data, the FishBase branching pattern of the spoked dendrogram is
maintained to generate other two dendrograms.
<BR>
<P>
Figure 4. Temporal coverage of (A) catch/landings, (B) spawning stock
biomass and (C) recruitment. The temporal coverage for individual
assessments is represented by thin alternating black and grey
horizontal lines in the main panels. Thick horizontal lines at the
base of each main panel represent the time periods which are present
in 90% (black) and 50% (grey) of all series for that data type.
Subfigure histograms contain the frequency of occurrence of the
various timespans without reference to time period. Solid and
long-dash vertical lines within the subfigures represent the median,
2.5% and 97.5% quantiles, respectively.
<BR>
<P>
Figure 5. Current exploitation rate versus biomass for XXX
individual stocks. Exploitation is scaled relative to that which
should allow maximum sustainable yield (uMSY); biomass is scaled
relative to BMSY. Colors indicate probability of occurrence as
revealed by a kernel density smooth function. Solid circles indicate
BMSY and uMSY that were obtained directly from assessments; open circles
indicate that they were estimated from surplus production models.
<BR>
<P>
Figure 6. Current exploitation rate versus biomass for
individual stocks grouped by management unit. Plot details as in
Figure 5.
<BR>
<P>
Figure 7. Mean trophic level of assessed species for
overexploited and non-overexploited stocks. Overexploited stocks are
those for which the current biomass is below the MSY BRP.
