Introduction</A>

<P>
Marine wild capture fisheries provide more than 80 million tons of
fisheries products (both food and industrial) per year and employ 43.5
million people (wild capture and aquaculture, <A
 HREF="node27.html#FAO:fishstat">FAO (2009)</A>).
At the same time, fishing has been recognized as one of the most
widespread human impacts in the world's oceans
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Halpern:etal:2008:science">Halpern <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2008</A>), and the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that two-thirds of fish stocks are fully
exploited or overexploited (<A
 HREF="node27.html#FAO:fishstat">FAO, 2009</A>).  While many fisheries
have reduced exploitation rates to levels that should promote
recovery, overfishing continues to be a serious global problem
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Worm:etal:2009:science">Worm <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2009</A>).  Fishery managers are asked to address
multiple competing objectives including maximizing yields, ensuring
profitability, reducing bycatch, and minimizing the risk of
overfishing.  Given the enormous social and economic costs
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Rice:etal:2003:icescm">Rice <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2003</A>) and ecosystems consequences
(<A NAME="tex2html66" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Myers:etal:2007:science">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2007</A>; <A NAME="tex2html67" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Frank:etal:2005:science">Frank <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2005</A>) of collapsed
fisheries, it is imperative that we are able to quickly learn the
lessons of successful and failed fisheries from around the world.

<P>
Effective management of exploited fish populations generally requires
an understanding of where the current population size and harvest rate
lie in relation to the population size and harvest rate which maximize
fishery benefits or limit the risk of overfishing.  This process of
quantitative determination of stock status and estimation of reference
points is called stock assessment.  Some fisheries in developing
countries have apparently provided sustainable yields for long periods
of time without formal stock assessment (e.g., many community-managed
fisheries in Oceania, <A
 HREF="node27.html#Johannes:2002:arees">Johannes (2002)</A>).  This has been achieved by
limiting harvest rates, often through gear restrictions or seasonal or
area closures.  In modern industrialized fisheries where fishing
capacity exceeds the productivity of fished stocks, however, stock
assessment is an integral component of responsible
management (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Hilborn:Walters:1992">Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992</A>).

<P>
Even in developed countries, however, not all stocks are assessed.
For example, in 2007, of the 528 fish and invertebrate stocks
recognized by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), only 179
or slightly over one third were fully assessed (<A
 HREF="node27.html#NMFS:2008:status">National Marine Fisheries Service, 2008</A>).  An
assessment by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2006 indicated
that the percentage of commercial landings obtained from assessed
stocks ranged between 66-97 percent in northern European waters and
30-77 percent in the Mediterranean (<A
 HREF="node27.html#eea:2009:status">European Environment Agency, 2009</A>).  The New Zealand
Ministry of Fisheries reports the status of 117 stocks or sub-stocks
out of a total of 628 stocks managed under New Zealand's Quota
Management System (<A
 HREF="node27.html#NZMF:2009">New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries, 2009</A>).  In Australia, 98 federally managed
stocks have been assessed (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Wilson:etal:2009:status">Wilson <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2009</A>) out of an unknown
total. The extent to which stocks are assessed elsewhere in the world
is currently unknown.

<P>
The global database of fishery landings compiled by Food and
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (<A
 HREF="node27.html#FAO:fishstat">FAO, 2009</A>)
and synthesized by the Sea Around Us project
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Watson:etal:2005:fandf">Watson <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2004</A>) has proven to be a valuable resource
for understanding fishery status; however, catch data alone can be
misleading when used as a proxy for stock size.  Many papers have used
these catch databases to examine changes in fishery status
(<A NAME="tex2html68" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Worm:etal:2006:science">Worm <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>; <A NAME="tex2html69" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Costello:etal:2008:science">Costello <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2008</A>), including
changes in trophic level (<A NAME="tex2html70" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Essington:etal:2006:procnatacadsci">Essington <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>; <A NAME="tex2html71" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Pauly:etal:1998">Pauly <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1998</A>; <A NAME="tex2html72" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Newton:etal:2007:currentbiol">Newton <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2007</A>).
Most of these analyses rely (either explicitly or implicitly) on the
assumption that catch or landings is a reliable index of stock size.
Critics have pointed out that catch can change for a number of reasons
unrelated to stock size, including changes in targeting, fishing
restrictions, or market preferences (<A NAME="tex2html73" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Hilborn:2007:science">Hilborn, 2007</A>; <A NAME="tex2html74" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Murawski:Methot:Tromble:2007:science">Murawski <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2007</A>; <A NAME="tex2html75" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#deMutsert:etal:2008:pnas">de&nbsp;Mutsert <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2008</A>).  Even
when catch is standardized by the amount of fishing effort
(catch-per-unit-of-effort, CPUE), it can be an unreliable index of
relative abundance (<A NAME="tex2html76" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Walters:2003:cjfas">Walters, 2003</A>; <A NAME="tex2html77" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Harley:etal:2001:cjfas">Harley <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2001</A>; <A NAME="tex2html78" target="contents"

  HREF="node27.html#Hutchings:Myers:1994:cjfas">Hutchings &amp; Myers, 1994</A>).
Stock assessments consider time series of catch along with other
sources of information such as: natural mortality rates, changes in
size or age composition, stock-recruitment relationships, and CPUE of
different sectors or of fishery-independent surveys.  Because they
integrate across multiple sources of information, stock assessment
models are thought to provide a more accurate picture of changes in
abundance than catch data alone (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Sibert:etal:2006:science">Sibert <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>). Yet,
without a current and comprehensive database of stock assessments,
scientists wishing to conduct comparative analyses of marine fish
population dynamics and fishery status have little choice but to use
problematic catch data.

<P>
The first global database of stock assessment information, the Myers
Stock Recruitment Database, was developed by Ransom Myers and
colleagues in the mid-1990s (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Myers:etal:1995:summary">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1995b</A>).  While
the database was primarily known for its time series of stock and
recruitment, it did contain time series of fishing mortality rates for
many stocks but biological reference points were largely absent. The
original release version of the Myers database
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Myers:etal:1995:summary">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1995b</A>) contained spawning stock size and recruitment time series
for 274 stocks representing 92 species as well as time series of
fishing mortality rates for 144 stocks. 
It was used to: <BR>

...Myers:etal:1999:cjfas, Myers:etal:2002:najfm,
Dorn:2002:najfm} \end{inparaenum}">
<BR>, amongst others.  The Myers
database has also been used for several studies of collapse and
recovery of exploited fish populations (<A NAME="tex2html80" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Hilborn:1997:csiro">Hilborn, 1997</A>; <A NAME="tex2html81" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Hutchings:2000:nature">Hutchings, 2000</A>,<A NAME="tex2html82" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Hutchings:2001:jfishb">2001</A>) and to study depensation dynamics (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Garvey:etal:2009:cjfas">Garvey <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2009</A>).

<P>
Although the original Myers database (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Myers:etal:1995:summary">Myers <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 1995b</A>)
has proven to be a valuable resource, it is now 15 years out of date.
For stocks that were depleted in 1995, these additional 15 years
include valuable observations at low stock size or of a recovering
population, both of which are critical for estimating population
dynamics parameters such as the slope of the stock-recruitment
relationship near the origin and for evaluating evidence for
depensation. In addition, there have been numerous improvements in
stock assessment methodologies (including important advances in
statistical catch-at-age or catch-at-length models) and assessments
have been conducted for the first time for many species.

<P>
Previous meta-analyses of fishery status have been hampered by the
lack of a global assessment database containing biological reference
points (BRPs, e.g., the biomass and fishing mortality rate that
produce maximum sustainable yield, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$B_{MSY}$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$F_{MSY}$"></SPAN>).  Knowledge of BRPs
is important if stocks are to be managed for high yields that can be
sustained over time (<A
 HREF="node27.html#Mace:1994:cjfas">Mace, 1994</A>).  Without information on
reference points, previous analyses of stock assessments or catch data
have been forced to use non-biological thresholds to define fishery
status, such as the greatest 15 year decline
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Hutchings:Reynolds:2004:biosci">Hutchings &amp;
  Reynolds, 2004</A>) or 10 percent of maximum catch
(<A
 HREF="node27.html#Worm:etal:2006:science">Worm <SPAN  CLASS="textit">et&nbsp;al.</SPAN>, 2006</A>). Ad hoc reference points based on some
fraction of the maximum of a time series also have undesirable
statistical properties and can result in false collapses when applied
to inherently variable time series of catch or abundance
(<A NAME="tex2html83" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#branch:2008:marpol">Branch, 2008</A>; <A NAME="tex2html84" target="contents"
  HREF="node27.html#Wilberg:Miller:2007:science">Wilberg &amp; Miller, 2007</A>).  Complicating
comparisons of fishery status is the fact that different BRPs are used
in different parts of the world and even the same BRP can be used in a
different manner, for example, as a target or a limit. 

<P>
Here we present a new global database of stock assessments for
commercially exploited marine fish populations.  The database is an
update and extension of that developed by Ransom Myers, and is named
the RAM Legacy database in honor of his pioneering contribution.  This
effort is the first global stock assessment database to:

<OL>
<LI>Use a formal relational database structure;
</LI>
<LI>Use source control software to handle release versions are maintained;
</LI>
<LI>Include metadata related to the geographic location of the stock, the type of assessment model used, and the original source document for the assessment data;
</LI>
<LI>Include biological reference points and stock-specific life history information. 
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We use the database to assess the knowledge-base for management of marine fish populations and address the following questions:

<OL>
<LI>What fraction of world wild-capture fishery landings come from assessed stocks and how does this proportion vary by region?
</LI>
<LI>What is the temporal coverage of stock assessments, i.e. how far back do stock assessments look when reconstructing trends in abundance?
</LI>
<LI>What are the taxonomic and geographic biases, if any, in assessed stocks?
</LI>
<LI>Which stock assessment approaches are used and how does this vary by region?
</LI>
<LI>What biological reference points are reported in assessments and how does this vary by region?
</LI>
<LI>How accessible is stock assessment information in different regions?
</LI>
</OL>
