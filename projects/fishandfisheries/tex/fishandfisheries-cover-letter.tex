\opening{Dear Dr. Pitcher,}
% justification
Please find attached a manuscript titled ``\textit{Assessing the knowledge-base for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates with a new global database of stock assessments}'', that we wish to submit
for review to Fish and Fisheries.

This work is the first global compilation of stock assessment data
since the pioneering work of our late colleague Ransom A. Myers in the
1990s and we believe that it will make an important contribution to
fisheries research. We are committed to making the database used for
the analyses available to other practitioners and feel that Fish and
Fisheries is the best journal to reach our intended audience of
fisheries scientists.

We would like to propose the following 3 reviewers for this manuscript:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{Dr. Rainer Froese} - Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences, D\"{u}sternbrooker Weg 20, 24105 Kiel, Germany - Phone: +49 (431) 600 4579, Fax: +49 (431) 600 1699 - Email: rfroese@ifm-geomar.de
 \item \textbf{Dr. Keith Sainsbury} - Division of Marine Research, CSIRO GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tasmania 7001, Australia - Phone: +61 3 6232 5369, Fax: +61 3 6232 5199 - Email: Keith.Sainsbury@csiro.au
 \item \textbf{Dr. Randall Peterman} - School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada V5A 1S6 - Phone: (778) 782-4683, Fax: (778) 782-4968 - Email: peterman@sfu.ca
\end{enumerate}

These individuals conduct research in themes related to the global
status of fish stocks and have not been associated with the present
work. Dr. Froese provided us with a detailed taxonomic list of fish
species from FishBase but was otherwise not involved in any of the
analyses.  The material contained in the submitted manuscript is
original and has not been submitted to other journals. 
%All co-authors have provided me with written approval prior to this submission.

We look forward to hearing from you regarding this manuscript
submission.
