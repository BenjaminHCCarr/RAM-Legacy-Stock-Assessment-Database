\chapter{Introduction}

% \citep{Myers:etal:1995a}
In 1995 the late Ransom A. Myers and colleagues first published a summary of their newly compiled worldwide database of stock-recruitment data for marine species (Myers, R. A., J. Bridson, and N.J. Barrowman. 1995. Summary of Worldwide Spawner and Recruitment Data. Can. Tech. Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 2020: iv + 327 p.). This database has since been used in a large number of publications, leading to important advances in fisheries science and ecology (please refer to the following URL for a list of Dr. Myers' publications: \url{http://as01.ucis.dal.ca/ramweb/content.php?lang=en&i=4&sub=0}). Increasingly, however, analyses became limited by the lack of updating for many of the stocks, providing potentially an outdated picture of the status of marine fisheries. This document summarizes the contents of an updated database of stock assessments.

% Dr. Ransom A. Myers compiled a worldwide database of stock-recruitment data for marine species. In early 2008, a group of colleagues decided to update his database with new stock assessments.

% This document is meant to support research efforts associated with the National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) working group ``Finding Common Ground in Marine Conservation and Management''. The current document contains summary graphs for the different fish stock assessments present in the updated stock-recruitment database under development at Dalhousie University.
