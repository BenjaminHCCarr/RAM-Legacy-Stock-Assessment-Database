Moving from one quadrant to another quadrant in the contour plot can occur from a change in exploitation rate or by a change in biomass or both. Changes in exploitation rate can be sudden and are often associated with management action such as increases or reductions in fishing mortality. Changes in biomass, on the other hand, are limited by biological realities and will often be less volatile than changes associated with managing exploitation. Moving from the top to the bottom quadrants is associated with reduction in fishing mortality whereas moving from the left quadrants to the right quadrants indicates an increase in biomass.
