\subsection*{Temporal Trends in Abundance: Alternative Model Fits}
In addition to the continuous piece-wise model described in the main
body of the paper to compare regression slopes before and after 1992,
we fit two other models to evaluate the robustness of our results. The
first was a less biologically realistic, discontinuous piece-wise
model with no continuity constraint 

\begin{equation}
ln\left(SSB_{t}\right) = \alpha + \delta_{\alpha}\eta_{t} + \left(\beta + \delta_{\beta}\eta_{t}\right)t + \epsilon_{t}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{\alpha}$ is the change in intercept post-1992. The equations
used for the continuous and discontinuous piece-wise models assume
independence and that variability around the mean arises from
measurement error. Thus, for comparison, we also fit a random-walk
state-space model (Durbin and Koopman 2001) with pre- and post-1992
drift terms via a Kalman filter with measurement and process error
estimation attempted: 

\begin{equation}
ln\left(SSB_{obs,t}\right) = ln\left(SSB_{true,t}\right) + \nu_{t}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
ln\left(SSB_{true,t+1}\right) = ln\left(SSB_{true,t}\right) + \beta + \delta_{\beta}\eta_{t} + \zeta_{t}
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

where $SSB_{obs,t}$ the assessment-derived spawning stock biomass in year t, $SSB_{true,t+1}$ is
the estimate of the true state of the spawning stock biomass, and $\nu_{t}$
and $\zeta_{t}$ are the normally distributed measurement and process errors,
respectively. The equations for all three models use the same
parameter symbols for continuity but each will have a model-specific
interpretation. The random-walk state-space model consistently yielded
estimates of low to absent measurement error variability. This had the
effect of reducing the model to a process-variance model where the
model fit often, but not always, conformed closely with the observed
data. The near absence of measurement error variability can be
attributed to either the low-frequency nature of the time series,
which presumably resulted from the assessments being aggregated across
multiple ages and cohorts, thus producing a relatively smooth biomass
series where the error variances are difficult to separate, or the
relative simplicity of the implemented state space model (Equation~\ref{eq:3}).
