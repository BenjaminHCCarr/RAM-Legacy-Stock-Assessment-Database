Dear Mike,
Thanks again for the NMFS data. I'm really happy to see some enthusiasm in this project and really look forward to including NMFS assessments in the new stock-recruitment database (srDB).

For srDB, we have developed a relational model that we implemented in a PostgreSQL database system. The spreadsheet template that we have developed is used to process the data and load them in the backend database. This step is handled by a Perl script that reads from the Excel files and sends SQL commands to insert data in the database server. 

The data that you sent us differs from our Excel template in a variety of ways. I have no doubt that I can write another Perl script to handle your data. However, it seems to me that the Excel files that you provided were themselves produced from a relational system. Is this what "SIS" is? 

If it is the case that you are managing the assessment results from a relational database, I believe that a few properly defined queries and functions should suffice to extract the same data in a format consistent with our template spreadsheet. 

The basic design principles for srDB are that stocks are composed of a combination of a species and an area, and each assessment consists of a stock and an assessor. So we end up with a single Excel file for each assessment. 

Please let me know your thoughts. 

All the best.

Dan
