Sean Anderson, working with the data for his stock status classification paper noted some cases where the biomass ratio reported in the FaF paper was TB/TBmsy, not SSB/SSBmsy as it should. These stocks had both TBmsy and SSBmsy defined and the code for the fried eggs mistakenly chose the TB/TBmsy ratio.The following 2 assessments were affected by this:

SEFSC-TILESATLC-1961-2002-STANTON (B/Bmsy ratio changed from 0.9 to 0.94)

SPC-STMARLINSWPO-1950-2003-JENSEN (B/Bmsy ratio changed from 0.75 to 0.7)

 
Another mistake was found with NWFSC-DKROCKPCOAST-1928-2007-BRANCH, where the units for SSBmsy (E03eggs) were not included in the definition of the view srdb.reference_point_values_view, this was changed and that assessid now appears in the view.

(Daniel Ricard, while working on Ph.D. prelim): I noticed that the B/Bmsy reported for NWFSC-WROCKPCOAST-1955-2006-BRANCH is from the Schaefer fits, whereas there is a SSBmsy defined. The units between the SSBmsy reference point and the SSB time series did not match because of units normalisation in the timeseries. I fixed this. The ratio changed from 0.91 to 0.88.
