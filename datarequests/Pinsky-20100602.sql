-- notes from Skype call on June 02 2010
--
--each stock a line
--each column is a year
--ratios in there

-- get the stocks that have an MSY reference point
-- one of SSB or TB, just one, with a reference point, if they both have reference points, chose SSB preferentially

---no SSB but TB and Bmsy
--1950 to the present

--after the fact, Malin trims out non-species and does manual edits for scientific names that are not in fishbase
-- WHAT ARE THOSE SPECIES?
