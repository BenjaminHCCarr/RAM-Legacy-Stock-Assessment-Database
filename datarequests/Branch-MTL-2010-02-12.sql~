-- SQL code to extract data for Trevor Branch's Mean Trophic Level paper
-- Time-stamp: <Last modified: 26 FEBRUARY   (srdbadmin)>
--
-- this data request is handled by a Poi issue on RAMlegacy:
-- http://www.marinebiodiversity.ca/RAMlegacy/ramlegacy-bug-reporting/440

-- Criterion would be any time series with at least 25 data points within the 30 years 1977-2006. Total biomass where available, otherwise spawning biomass. Only series with units in MT need apply. 

-- invocation for generating CSV file:
-- set comma as field separator 
-- add double-quotes around strings
