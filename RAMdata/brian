Dear Keith and Henrik:

Ram Myers and I are working on some multi-population analyses of fish stock and recruitment
relationships.  One of the variables that we would like to include in the analyses is a quantitative
measure of bottom area for the different stocks that are assessed by ICES Working Groups.  Do
you know if anyone has compiled estimates of area of sea bottom for different depth strata (e. g.,
area of sea bottom  shallower than 50 m, between 50-150 m, etc.)?  Ideally what would be useful
would be area estimates similar to those that Henrik Sparholt prepared for the Baltic.

If you are aware of any such data for any of the major stocks assessed by ICES (perhaps
assembled in connection with Cod and Climate Change or research survey activities?), could you
please send us a citation reference to the report?  We thank you very much for whatever
assistance you may be able to provide.  

Best wishes,

Brian MacKenzie and Ram Myers

P. S. Please send reply to Rams' email address.
