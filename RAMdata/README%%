Identification Codes (IDs)
==========================

Associated with each stock in the database is a standard alphanumeric ID.
For example, the ID for American Plaice in NAFO divisions 3LNO is AMPL3LNO.
 

Naming Conventions for Stock ID's
=================================

The ID's used to represent the datasets were chosen as systematically
as possible.  Choosing ID's involves a trade-off between information
and length, i.e. we would like short but meaningful ID's.
The convention used in forming ID's is

       <Species Abbreviation><Region Abbreviation>

For example, the ID for the Iceland Capelin dataset is represented
by joining CAPE (short for Capelin) and ICE (short for iceland), giving

       CAPEICE

Unfortunately, various inconsistencies do exist, mostly due to: 

   - confusion regarding similar species, 
   - recent taxonomic changes, and
   - revised ID's.
 
The following is a list, in alphabetical order, of the species abbreviations
currently in use, give or take a few.  Some of these are not ideal (for
example, some are too long!) and should eventually be revised. 
Some are marked with question marks and/or asterisks to indicate
inconsistent usage or confusion.

Storage of Information for Each Stock
=====================================

A stock (say it has ID STOCKID) is represented by two files:

         STOCKID.doc      and       STOCKID.dat

The .doc file contains fields of information describing the stock, etc.
The .dat file contains time series for the stock (including, among other
things, spawning stock and recruitment).

SPECIAL NOTE FOR DOS MACHINES: DOS filenames are limited to 8 characters
for the main part of the filename optionally followed by a dot (.) and 
a 3 character extension.  Most of the ID's (and hence the filenames) in
this database fall within this limitation, however several do not.
This may prove somewhat confusing because in converting the filenames for
use on DOS machines, long filenames are truncated.  However the ID
field in the .doc file (see below) will be correct.

Format of .doc Files
====================

The fields used are the following:
 
ID        : Alphanumeric identifier for this stock
SP        : Common species name 
LATIN     : Scientific name for species 
            Note: there should be a one-to-one relationship between SP
            and LATIN.
FAMILY    : Family (latin)
CFAMILY   : Common family name
            Note: there should be a one-to-one relationship between FAMILY
            and CFAMILY.
ORDER     : Order
STOCK     : Stock descriptor 
SOURCE    : Source of data
COMMENTS  : Comments
FAGE      : Ages used to compute the Fishing mortality.
METHOD    : Method of estimating recruitment and stock (e.g. VPA, RV, cpue).
UNITSSB   : Units of spawning stock biomass data
UNITREC   : Units of recruitment data
AGERECDAT : Age of recruitment
UNITLAND  : Units of landings data
EGGDIAM   : Diameter of eggs
LHATCH    : Length at hatch
LMETA     : Length at metamorphosis
DELTAL    : Change in length during larval phase
DELTAN    : Change in length during larval phase relative to egg diameter
LATITUDE  : Latitude of spawning expressed as two numbers separated by a space.
            The first number is degrees (positive means North, negative means
            South).  The second number is minutes.
LONGITUDE : Longitude of spawning expressed as two numbers separated by a space.
            The first number is degrees (positive means East, negative means
            West).  The second number is minutes.
MONTHSPA  : Month spawning
NATMORT   : Natural mortality
F01       : Fishing mortality corresponding to the point at which the 
            marginal yield per recruit from an additional unit of effort 
            is 0.1 the marginal yield per recruit at very low levels of
            fishing (and hence a point beyond which there is little reward
            in increasing fishing).
FMAX      : Fishing mortality corresponding to maximum yield per recruit.
FMED      : Fishing mortality corresponding to median yield per recruit.
KGPRECF0  : "Kilograms per recruit when fishing mortality = 0."
            This is something of a misnomer.  In fact it is specifies
            spawners (in either kg or numbers, depending on whether
            the UNITSSB field specifies weight or numbers) per 
            recruit (generally in numbers but possibly in kg, depending on
            whether the UNITREC field specifies numbers or weight).       
SPAWNLOC  : Spawning location (e.g. shelf, slope, estuary)
SOURCEMAT : Source of maturity data.
LENMAT    : Length at maturity (males and females combined).
LENMATM   : Length at maturity for males.
LENMATF   : Length at maturity for females.
AGEMAT    : Age at maturity (males and females combined).
AGEMATM   : Age at maturity for males.
AGEMATF   : Age at maturity for females.
LENREC    : Length at recruitment. 
AGEREC    : Age at recruitment (males and females combined).
AGERECM   : Age at recruitment for males.
AGERECF   : Age at recruitment for females.
SOURCEGRO : Source of growth data.
LINFIN    : L_infinity parameter in the von Bertalanffy equation
            (males & females combined).
k         : k parameter in the von Bertalanffy equation
            (males & females combined).
to        : to parameter in the von Bertalanffy equation
            (males & females combined).
LINFINM   : L_infinity parameter for males.
kM        : k parameter for males.
toM       : to parameter for males.
LINFINF   : L_infinity parameter for females.
kF        : k parameter for females.
toF       : to parameter for females.
SOURCEab  : Source of a,b data. 
aLTWTPAR  : a, length wt. parameter (males & females combined).
bLTWTPAR  : b, length wt. parameter (males & females combined).
aLTWTPARM : a, length wt. parameter for males.
bLTWTPARM : b, length wt. parameter for males.
aLTWTPARF : a, length wt. parameter for females.
bLTWTPARF : b, length wt. parameter for females.


Each line of the file consists of the name of a field (as above) followed
by a separator character (@) and then the contents of the field. 
The fields are always listed in the standard order (as above).
A dot (.) denotes a missing value.  Some of the fields listed are not
currently in use.


A Note on Common and Scientific Names
-------------------------------------

As noted above, there should be a one-to-one relationship between

         SP and LATIN

and also between

         FAMILY and CFAMILY.

One reason scientific names exist is that common names often vary 
from place to place.  We have arbitrarily adopted "standard" common names
which should always correspond exactly (i.e. in a one-to-one way) with
the scientific names.
         

Format of .dat Files
====================
 
Each file contains five columns of data:

       YEARorYEARCLASS   SSB   REC   LAND   FRPL
 
YEARorYEARCLASS refers to the year for SSB, LAND, and FRPL.  
It refers to the yearclass for REC.
All four digits are used (e.g. 1984 rather than 84).
 
SSB is the spawning stock biomass in that year.
REC is the recruitment for that yearclass.  
LAND is the landings for that year.
FRPL is the fishing mortality for that year.

Note that a dot (.) denotes a missing value, as in the .doc files.
